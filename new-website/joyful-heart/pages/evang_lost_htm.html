        <p>Alford Usher Soord (1868-1915), &quot;The Lost Sheep&quot;Friends gathered for the funeral of a 21-year-old who died in a motorcycle accident. They didn&#x27;t seem to connect with Jesus&#x27; words that I spoke that day. They did connect, however, with the release of helium balloons that a family member had arranged after the service was over. That spoke to them. They weren&#x27;t Christian believers, so far as I could sense. Nor, from all reports, was the deceased a follower of Christ. He died without knowing Christ. He was lost — or was he?</p>
        <p>At least that&#x27;s what our culture tells us. The prevailing world-view in many regions of America holds several truths to be self-evident:</p>

          <img src="../scraped_data/images/dbdfd0bc_soord-lost-sheep224x356.jpg" alt="Alford Usher Soord (1868-1915), The Lost Sheep" loading="lazy">
          <figcaption>Alford Usher Soord (1868-1915), The Lost Sheep</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This point of view is called universalism. It&#x27;s popular, even with many who call themselves Christians. But how do we know whether universalism is or is not aChristianview?</p>
        <p>Christians go back to the teachings of Jesus himself as the absolute authority for what constitutes true Christianity. After all, he founded it. So let&#x27;s focus on this single topic and inquire:</p>
        <p>In examining the Gospels which record Jesus&#x27; teaching, the English word &quot;lost&quot; appears in 16 passages that comprise eight separate teaching settings. (For the purpose of careful analysis I&#x27;m displaying the key Greek verbs. Greek, of course, is the language in which the New Testament was originally written.1)</p>
        <p>I think we can agree that in #1 and #7 above, Jesus isn&#x27;t talking about lost people, but the other six passages he most certainly does.</p>
        <p>To understand Jesus teaching about lostness, we must understand the Greek verbapollumi, &quot;destroy.&quot; It bears three basic definitions in the New Testament — and is used in additional passages besides the ones listed above:</p>
        <p>So how does Jesus use this word in the &quot;lost&quot; passages? In the context of these parables he makes it pretty clear.</p>
        <p>The phrase &quot;lost sheep of the house of Israel&quot; is explained in the context of the conversion and repentance of Zacchaeus, the Jewish tax collector, who was despised for his excessive taxation. Jesus says about Zacchaeus:</p>
        <p>By &quot;lost sheep of the house of Israel&quot; then, Jesus is referring to Jewish sinners, that is, Jews who haven&#x27;t yet repented of their sins. These people who believe in the Jewish faith, but who have strayed away, who are no longer following their faith, and who are in danger.</p>
        <p>This understanding is reinforced by the Parable of the Lost Son or Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32). The younger son represents repentant Jewish sinners who return to the Father&#x27;s family, while the older son represent righteous Jews who don&#x27;t need to repent. The purpose of this parable is to explain why Jesus took time to welcome, minister to, and eat with &quot;tax collectors and sinners&quot; (Luke 15:1-2). On an earlier occasion, Jesus had explained:</p>
        <p>In some manuscripts, at least, Jesus repeats this saying in the immediate context of the Parable of the Lost Sheep (18:10-14): &quot;For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost&quot; (Matthew 18:11, KJV, Textus Receptus). This lost sheep &quot;went astray&quot; (planeō, &quot;wander&quot;). It goes off by itself in the steep ravines and gullies and becomes separated from the flock and the protecting shepherd. This &quot;lost sheep&quot; will be eaten by wild animals if left to itself. So the shepherd scours the hills until he finds it. In Matthew the &quot;punch line&quot; for the parable is this: &quot;In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost&quot; (NIV, NRSV) or &quot;perish&quot; (KJV,apollumi, Matthew 18:14). This is the equivalent of saying, &quot;God does not will&quot; the perishing of any of them.3The phrase &quot;these little ones&quot; here seems to refer to either children or disciples who are being lured by sin and temptation (Matthew 18:6, 10, 14). Jesus&#x27; teaching here sounds a great deal Peter&#x27;s teaching decades later: &quot;He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish (apollumi), but everyone to come to repentance&quot; (2 Peter 3:9).</p>
        <p>The point of this parable is finding and thus protecting sheep that otherwise would die from the elements or be ravaged by enemies. &quot;Finding sheep&quot; is obviously the act of rescuing or saving them.</p>
        <p>Doubtless Jesus told his parables time and time again, sometimes stressing one point, sometimes another. As we have observed, in Luke&#x27;s Gospel Jesus usesapollumiin the sense of lost/found in three related parables: The Lost Sheep (15:3-7), the Lost Coin (15:8-10), and the Lost Son (15:11-32). In each case something is lost, searched for, found, and rejoiced over. In two of the three parables, Jesus explains what the rejoicing in the parable stands for:</p>
        <p>In other words, thelostsheep andlostcoin refer to a sinner who needs repentance, while thefoundsheep andfoundcoin refer to a sinner who repents.</p>
        <p>Jesus uses the term &quot;lost&quot; twice in John&#x27;s Gospel to state:</p>
        <p>Jesus, of course, is referring to Judas who betrayed him. It is pretty obvious that Jesus is talking about preserving a person for eternal life, which is the opposite of being lost in eternal death — one &quot;doomed to destruction&quot; or in the KJV &quot;the son of perdition.&quot;</p>
        <p>I conclude that &quot;lost&quot; refers to unrepentant persons who will miss out on eternal life unless they are &quot;found,&quot; that is, rescued or saved and brought to a place of repentance and forgiveness.</p>
        <p>Jesus&#x27; teaching on lostness is unambiguous. Now it is a question of whether wewantto believe it or not.</p>
        <p>Do we follow our ungodly culture that has a strong motivationnotto believe in hell and eternal lostness? Or do we believe Jesus, the Son of the God, who reveals to us true nature of spiritual realities?</p>
        <p>If I have been accurate in explaining how the word &quot;lost&quot; is used by Jesus — and I invite you to check me out to be sure that I have done this carefully — then we followers of Jesus, we believers in Jesus&#x27; teaching,mustembrace Jesus&#x27; concern for the lost — those who are doomed to miss out on eternal life unless they are &quot;found&quot; or &quot;rescued.&quot;</p>
        <p>For too long many of us Christians have been embarrassed by the word &quot;lost.&quot; For too long we have banished it not only from our vocabularies, but have dropped rescuing &quot;lost&quot; people from our church priorities. We have succumbed to group-think and in the process have gotten badly off target.</p>
        <p>Let us recover Jesus&#x27; true heart towards the lost. To do this, first we must be willing to accept Jesus&#x27; own teaching that people are actually &quot;lost&quot; eternally without his salvation. Second, we must adopt Jesus&#x27; own passion to &quot;seek and to save the lost.&quot; Only then can we be classed as &quot;followers&quot; in this crucial part of Jesus&#x27; mission. Only then will be truly loving to those who are lost.</p>
