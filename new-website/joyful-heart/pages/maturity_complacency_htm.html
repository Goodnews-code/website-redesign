        <p>Charles Sprague Pearce, &#x27;Prayer&#x27; (1886), mural in the north corridor, Great Hall, Thomas Jefferson Building at the Library of Congress, Washington DC.</p>
        <p>We humans tend to begin spiritual things with enthusiasm, but after a while fall back into lethargic default patterns. We realize that we&#x27;ve slacked off, but we can&#x27;t seem to summon the energy to get moving again. We say we mean well, but our excuses for our spiritual laziness are lame. Our heart just isn&#x27;t in it. We become sluggish. Dull of spirit. Stagnant. Complacent.</p>

        <p>In a wonderfully winsome passage (Hosea 6:3), God woos his complacent people to return to their first love.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Let us know;let us press on to know the Lord;his going out is sure as the dawn;he will come to us as the showers,as the spring rains that water the earth.&quot; (Hosea 6:3, ESV)</blockquote>
        <p>Let&#x27;s examine the verse. Two key verbs lie at the heart of the exhortation: &quot;know&quot; (NIV &quot;acknowledge&quot;) and &quot;press on.&quot;</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Let usknow;let us press on toknowthe Lord....&quot; (Hosea 6:3a)</blockquote>

        <figure class="article-figure animate-in">

        </figure>
        <p>The Hebrew word for &quot;know&quot; (yādaʿ) is used nearly 1,000 times in the Old Testament, with many shades of meaning, even as a euphemism for sexual intercourse. The unfortunate NIV translation &quot;acknowledge&quot; is possible, but unlikely.1Most modern translations see the connotation here as of knowing a person, &quot;know, get to know, become acquainted with.&quot;2The verb is used for the most intimate acquaintance. God knows Moses by name (Exodus 33:17) and talks to him face-to-face (Deuteronomy 34:10). Hosea exhorts us to &quot;know&quot; Yahweh personally. To reach out to him again, to seek him, to try to understand his ways and values, and to walk in them.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Let us know;let us press on to know the Lord....&quot; (Hosea 6:3a)</blockquote>
        <p>The second line repeats the exhortation &quot;to know,&quot; but adds urgency. &quot;Let us press on to know the Lord.&quot; &quot;Press on&quot; (NIV, ESV, NRSV), &quot;follow on&quot; (KJV) is verbrādap, &quot;pursue,&quot; here, &quot;push on to (know).&quot;3The word has the idea of setting off after someone to catch up with him.4This isn&#x27;t a passive idea. It requires action. Urgency. Now! We must make an effort to catch up with Yahweh so we can get to know him.5</p>
        <p>The alternative to diligently seeking the Lord is a kind of spiritual passivity.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Woe to you who arecomplacent6in Zion....&quot; (Amos 6:1a)</blockquote>
        <p>Comfort, tranquility, being &quot;at ease in Zion&quot; is not the posture God desires. Rather, we need a sense of urgency, of hunger that compels us to draw close to him. To the church at Laodicea, Jesus says,</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm -- neither hot nor cold I am about to spit you out of my mouth.&quot; (Revelation 3:15-16)</blockquote>
        <p>A hot drink warms you on a cold day. Cold water refreshes. But lukewarm? No! Sometimes we are in danger of placid inactivity towards God.</p>
        <p>I think of coasting on a bicycle. You can&#x27;t coast uphill, but on level ground or on a slight slope, you can go miles without pedaling. The writer of Hebrews warns us.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do notdrift away.&quot; (Hebrews 2:1)</blockquote>
        <p>You can lie snoozing on an air mattress without a care in the world, but the lazy, slow, incessant current will take you far downriver before you know it.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;We do not want you to becomelazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.&quot; (Hebrews 6:12)</blockquote>
        <p>The adjective translated &quot;lazy&quot; here means &quot;slow, sluggish, indolent, dull, languid.&quot;7</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;... Notneglectingto meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another....&quot; (Hebrews 10:25, ESV)</blockquote>
        <p>The verb here means, &quot;forsake, abandon, desert,&quot; and suggests separating a connection with something.8When we excuse ourselves from meeting with other believers, we are rejecting one of God&#x27;s chosen ways of keeping us sharp -- association and stimulation from God&#x27;s word and from people intent on serving the Lord (Hebrews 3:13).</p>
        <p>Our verse suggests a posture of leaning forward, pressing forward with urgency.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Let us press on to know the Lord.&quot; (Hosea 6:3, ESV)If you&#x27;ve ever watched a sprint in the summer Olympics, you see the front runners leaning forward just as they reach the finish line, a technique known as &quot;dipping.&quot; Leaning forward might just get them across the line a microsecond ahead of their competitor in a photo finish. It reminds me of Paul&#x27;s zeal in his letter to the Philippians, depicting just such a sprinter stretching forward as he nears the finish line.</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;One thing I do: Forgetting what is behind andstraining toward9to what is ahead,Ipress on10toward thegoalto win theprizefor which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.&quot; (Philippians 3:13-14)</blockquote>
        <p>There is effort required. But there is also the wonderful blessing of seeking God with all our heart.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Let us know,let us press on to know the LORD;hisappearing11is as sure as the dawn;he will come to uslike the showers,12like the spring rains13that water the earth.&quot; (Hosea 6:3, NRSV)</blockquote>
        <p>If we seek him, he will come out to meet us as predictably as the sun rises in the morning! &quot;His appearing is as sure as the dawn.&quot; Hosea compares Yahweh&#x27;s coming to us as refreshing showers after a dry spell, like spring rains that replenish the moisture of the soil so that growth can burst forth again.</p>
        <p>Do you need the Lord&#x27;s refreshing? Do you need his watering? Then reach out to him anew. Press beyond your current default level so that you might find him afresh. He&#x27;ll come out to meet you -- as surely as the sun will rise in the morning. Press on to know the Lord, my friend. Press on!</p>
        <p>Father, you know our frailty. Forgive us our passivity towards You. Renew in our hearts a hunger, a zeal to seek you with all our heart. To lean forward into You that we might receive Your refreshing, Your renewal, Your joyful peace. In Jesus&#x27; name, we pray. Amen.</p>
