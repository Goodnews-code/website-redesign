        <p>Are you stuck? Feel like you haven&#x27;t grown spiritually in years? There&#x27;s a pretty good chance that the issue has to do with surrender. In these classic verses -- and using the most graphic image imaginable -- Paul explains why surrender is so important and the pleasant fruits that flow from it. Take a few minutes and let us unpack these verses together.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;1Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God&#x27;s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God -- this is your spiritual act of worship.2Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God&#x27;s will is -- his good, pleasing and perfect will.&quot; (Romans 12:1-2)</blockquote>

        <p>Romans is Paul&#x27;s most theological letter. He has explained salvation and grace in the first eleven chapters. The first word in our passage, &quot;therefore,&quot; is the hinge that turns from theology to practice. The letter so far has been about God&#x27;s mercy and grace to us. Now, in light of these mercies, Paul calls us to action.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Therefore, Iurge1you, brothers and sisters, in view of2God&#x27;s mercy....&quot;3(Romans 12:1a)</blockquote>
        <p>This is not a suggestion. The apostle ispleadingwith us to surrender to Christ. He explains this surrender from two points of view.</p>
        <p>The first has to do with sacrifice.</p>

        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Offer your bodies as living sacrifices.&quot; (Romans 12:1b)</blockquote>
        <p>The image comes from Israel&#x27;s tabernacle in the wilderness, and later, from the temple in Jerusalem. Israel is a shepherd people told to bring one of their sheep, their cattle to God&#x27;s house. As we read in Leviticus 1, the worshipper confesses his sins and lays his hand on the head of his animal, figuratively transferring his sins to the animal. God has told him that He will accept this animal to take the man&#x27;s place, to bear his sin, to be an atonement for him.</p>
        <p>It is a scene both intimate and shocking. Now the worshipper slits the animal&#x27;s throat and it bleeds out before him. Next, the animal is skinned and its carcass cut into pieces. The priests lift the butchered pieces onto the altar, where the sacrifice burns until ashes are all that remain.</p>
        <p>Unless you are a farmer or hunter who has killed and butchered animals for food, you recoil at such images. Sacrifice is abhorrent! Just the way that sin itself is abhorrent! Sacrifice is a constant reminder of the deadly seriousness of sin -- and the mercy of God that accepts a substitute to die for sins instead of us. It is grace, a forgiveness not deserved. Under the New Covenant, Jesus is the Sacrifice for our sins, and the cross is the altar upon which his life is poured out on our behalf.</p>
        <p>Previously in Romans, Paul talks about Jesus&#x27; sacrifice. Now his words take a sudden twist.4</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Offer your bodies aslivingsacrifices.&quot;</blockquote>
        <p>God doesn&#x27;t want us dead, but alive. Living, breathing, obedient, loving, fully surrendered to him -- &quot;holy and pleasing to God.&quot;5Surrender is a sacred act that pleases God, because it is the response of a willing and trusting heart.</p>
        <p>Now Paul surprises us again:</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;This is yourspiritual act of worship.&quot;6(Romans 12:1c)</blockquote>
        <p>Worship goes way beyond singing and praying. This verse is radical: How you live out your life in your body is how you worship God! As Barclay puts it,</p>
        <p>&quot;Real worship is the offering of everyday life to God ... the offering of every moment and every action to God.&quot;7</p>
        <p>We dare not compartmentalize our lives. Everything we do and say we offer before God as our worship, our surrender to him.8</p>
        <div class="discussion-question"><strong>Question 1. </strong>To what degree am I really surrendered to Jesus -- acting the way I do, saying the things I say, treating people the way I treat them? What kind of worship am I offering to God? What is Jesus calling me to surrender to him so he can replace it with newness and wholeness and holiness?</div>
        <p>Now Paul shifts his image from sacrifices to pictures of molds and patterns.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world,9but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God&#x27;s will is -- his good, pleasing and perfect will.&quot; (Romans 12:2)</blockquote>
        <p>The word translated &quot;conform&quot; means &quot;to form according to a pattern or mold,&quot; then, &quot;to form or model after something.&quot;10J.B. Phillips catches the idea with his paraphrase: &quot;Don&#x27;t let the world around you squeeze you into its own mold.&quot;11</p>
        <p>A manufacturer will inject hot plastic into molds to produce everyday items such as bowls and bottles. Or pour molten iron into molds where it cools and takes the shape of the mold. In the kitchen, your molds might be a Bundt cake pan, a cupcake pan, a dessert mold for colored Jello (fruit-flavored gelatin), or a popsicles mold for flavored ice on a stick.</p>
        <p>Our culture is a powerful force that molds us. Thus God commands the Israelites:</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, where you lived, and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan, to which I am bringing you.... You shall follow my rules and keep my statutes and walk in them. I am the Lord your God.&quot; (Leviticus 18:3-4)</blockquote>
        <p>Without thinking, we begin to look and act like everyone else. The attitudes and morals of our society easily become the standards for our lives. These values infuse the programs we watch and our conversations with friends. The pressure to conform is subtle and pervasive. We become like chameleons that match our color to our surroundings. Unless we make a deliberate effort to remain faithful to Jesus, we find ourselves being pulled by the current of society and soon our boat has drifted far downriver.</p>
        <p>Eugene Peterson&#x27;s paraphrase inThe Message, puts verse 1 this way:</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Don&#x27;t become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking.&quot;</blockquote>
        <p>You must admit, we live in a corrupt culture, with values that twist away from God&#x27;s values, sometimes subtly, sometimes radically.12Paul tells us that the unspiritual man,</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;... Does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.&quot; (1 Corinthians 2:14)</blockquote>
        <div class="discussion-question"><strong>Question 2. </strong>How have my values subtly shifted over the years to those of my culture? What kinds of immorality do I accept now that once distressed me? Have I adjusted to the world or to God&#x27;s thoughts?</div>
        <p>Rather than conformity to the culture, Paul calls us to transformation and renewal.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;... But be transformed by the renewing of your mind.&quot; (Romans 12:2b)</blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Be transformed&quot; comes from a Greek word from which we get our word &quot;metamorphosis,&quot; the change from caterpillars into butterflies and tadpoles into frogs. The verbmetamorphoōhere means &quot;to change inwardly in fundamental character or condition, be changed, be transformed.&quot;13</p>
        <p>Themeansby which this transformation takes place is therenewal14of our minds. The ancients didn&#x27;t think in terms of &quot;brain,&quot; but the mind as the sum total of our whole mental and moral state of being.15Douglas Moo calls the renewal process a &quot;re-programming of the mind,&quot;16a whole new way of thinking.</p>
        <p>Our whole categories of thinking and evaluating need to change, if we would really understand God&#x27;s will. This transformation happens gradually by constant yielding to the Holy Spirit, by exposing ourselves to God&#x27;s thoughts in his Word. We change through daily Bible reading and reflection. We change as we sit under Biblical preaching and teaching. Prayer, meditation, seeking after God wholeheartedly and diligently changes us.</p>
        <p>With our mind renewed by the Spirit and the Word, we can begin to understand, to discern accurately what God wants.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then17you will be able to test and approve what God&#x27;s will is -- his good, pleasing and perfect will.&quot; (Romans 12:2)</blockquote>
        <p>The Greek worddokimazōunderlies this verse. It is variously translated: &quot;be able to test and approve&quot; (NIV) &quot;by testing you may discern&quot; (ESV), &quot;discern&quot; (NRSV), &quot;prove&quot; (KJV). Bear with me here. The verbdokimazōcomes from the noundokimē, &quot;a testing process, a test.&quot; The verb carries two related ideas. (1) &quot;To make a critical examination of something to determine genuineness, put to the test, examine.&quot; And then, (2) &quot;to draw a conclusion about worth on the basis of testing, prove, approve.&quot;18</p>
        <p>Just a few miles from my home, gold was discovered in 1848, bringing a huge wave of 49ers seeking their fortune in the California Gold Rush. Miners would pan for gold in the creeks, then scurry down to the local Assay Office in town to have their find tested to determine if it was gold, and if so, how pure it was. Then the assayer would certify his findings and set a value on the gold. That&#x27;s whatdozimazōrefers to: testing and assaying value.</p>
        <p>Back to our verse:Only with a renewed mind, we are able to test or assay with accuracy some thought or idea and determine whether or not it is God&#x27;s will. Corrupt minds plunge ahead blindly acting on whim and desire. Renewed minds are able and eager to discern and follow God&#x27;s will, his values, his thoughts, his way of living -- &quot;his good, pleasing and perfect will.&quot;19</p>
        <div class="discussion-question"><strong>Question 3. </strong>Do you take the effort to read and study God&#x27;s word? Do you sit regularly under Biblical teaching and preaching? Do you yield to the Holy Spirit who can renew your mind? Or have you short-circuited this process through laziness?</div>
        <p>One of my favorite hymns of surrender, written early in the last century, begins:</p>
        <p>&quot;Have Thine own way, Lord! have Thine own way!Thou art the Potter, I am the clay.Mold me and make me after Thy willWhile I am waiting, yielded and still.&quot;20</p>
        <p>Father, I surrender my whole body and mind to you. Let me live for You and for Your purposes. Transform and heal my corrupted mind so I can discern and approve of Your thoughts and make them my own -- and lead me in the way everlasting. In Jesus&#x27; name, I pray. Amen.</p>

Parallels show that it may express the spiritualizing of the cultic, and this its function in Romans 12:1, where our bodies are to be offered, not in immolation, but in spiritual worship (cf. 1 Peter 2:5).... This is better described as &#x27;spiritual worship&#x27; than as &#x27;rational&#x27;, for Paul is not thinking of what is meant in modern English by &#x27;rational&#x27;&quot; (Barrett,Romans, p. 231).</p>
