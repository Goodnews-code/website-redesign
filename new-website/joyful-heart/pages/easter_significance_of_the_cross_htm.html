        <p>As we approach Holy Week, as we begin to prepare our hearts, we meditate on the cross, and Christ&#x27;s resurrection.</p>
        <p>The meaning of the resurrection is obvious! Jesus conquers death and the grave. The Father raises him and displays him to the world in all his glory. Nothing hidden. No more secrets. Now, Jesus the Prophet, the Teacher, the Healer, the Son of David, is seen in the clear light of day to be Israel&#x27;s Messiah, Daniel&#x27;s Son of Man,1and the Father&#x27;s Only Son -- fully divine, with a name above every name.2The resurrection carries with it God&#x27;s stamp of validation.</p>

        <p>Wegetthe resurrection. But what about the cross? What doesthatmean? When we examine the heartbreaking events surrounding Jesus&#x27; crucifixion, we can become both morose and cynical.</p>
        <p>Yes, there are a few heroic moments -- Peter&#x27;s flashing sword, Joseph of Arimathea&#x27;s request for Jesus&#x27; body -- but many more moments are dastardly to the core.</p>
        <p>What does it all mean?</p>
        <p>Many to this day see Jesus&#x27; crucifixion in the tired category of a sad but inevitable martyr&#x27;s death -- injustice done, like so much injustice that is perpetrated upon reformers around the world. Jesus tried to change the system, tried valiantly, but he failed -- so they say. They see the sad and visible facts of the cross, but not the whole picture. Whatdoesthe cross mean?</p>
        <p>The significance of the cross is subtle -- but vital. Jesus says:</p>
        <p>But avoiding the crossisn&#x27;tpossible, not if the Father&#x27;s full plan is to be fulfilled. The meaning of the cross goes far beyond being an instrument of martyrdom. God is doing something here that isn&#x27;t immediately obvious. It is a mystery. Paul writes:</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.&quot; (1 Corinthians 2:8)</blockquote>
        <p>Satan wouldn&#x27;t have allowed it if he had known. He chortles to see Jesus playing right into his hands. The crucifixion is his ultimate victory. So he thinks. But it turns out he is wrong. Dead wrong. Consider this verse.</p>
        <p>Ponder that! Then these verses:</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;The reason the Son of God appeared was todestroy the devil&#x27;s work.&quot; (1 John 3:8b)</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;By his death he mightdestroy himwho holds the power of death -- that is,the devil-- and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.&quot; (Hebrews 2:14b-15)</blockquote>
        <p>Something cosmic happens on the cross. The world sees lightning and earthquakes and hours of blackness. But in the heavenly realms, something basic has changed!</p>
        <p>What exactly? It&#x27;s hard to know completely this side of heaven. But it has to do with Jesus being the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world,3and the Ransom given for all humankind that pays our debt in full,4we are &quot;bought with a price&quot;5-- &quot;the precious blood of Christ.&quot;6All of Satan&#x27;s taunting accusations against you fall before Jesus&#x27; victorious shout, &quot;It is finished!&quot;7You and I are saved from our desperate pit of sin! Our sins died with Jesus on the cross. They are gone! We are forgiven! Satan has no more power over us -- legal or usurped. We are free! Hallelujah.</p>
        <p>Sometimes truth is better understood in verse than theology. Recently -- in a book long out-of-print -- I found a wonderful poem that veteran pastor Jack Hayford wrote and set to music -- one of more than 600 songs and hymns God has given him over his lifetime. Read it and rejoice.</p>
        <p>All Is Wellby Jack Hayford</p>
        <p>Raised by hate upon a hill,Stark there stands a cross of wood.Look, the Man they take and killIs the Lamb, the Son of God.See the blood now freely flow;&quot;It is finished,&quot; hear Him cry!Who can understand or know:Death has won; yet death will die.</p>
        <p>Slashing wounds now scar the Lamb,Blemish free until He&#x27;s slain,Hammer blows into His handThunder forth again, again.See His Body raised in scorn,See the spear now split His side!Yet the vict&#x27;ry shall beWon by this Man thus crucified.</p>
        <p>Look! The Cross now raised on high --Symbol of Christ&#x27;s reign above.Cow&#x27;ring demons fear and fly,Driv&#x27;n before the flame of love.All of hell is mystified;Satan thought this hour his gain.See God&#x27;s wisdom glorified:Death destroyed in Jesus&#x27; name.</p>
        <p>Here is hope in hopelessness,Here is joy where all is pain.Here a fount of righteousnessFlows to all who make their claim.Come and drink here, come and live.Come and feast on life and peace.In the Cross God&#x27;s all He gives,In the Cross is full release.</p>
        <p>Tow&#x27;ring o&#x27;er all historyStands the Cross of Christ the King.Crossroad of all destiny,At the Cross is ev&#x27;rything.See here death hung on a Cross,See self slain upon a tree,See disease and ev&#x27;ry lossOverthrown through Calvary!</p>
        <p>All is well, all is well,Through Christ, our Conq&#x27;rer,All is well. (repeat)</p>
