          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">Yes. By all means. These are yours to use in your ministry. Just do not remove the copyright indication or post them on your website. However, if you use a map or reference to our materials in your sermon that appears on YouTube or on your church website, that&#x27;s okay. Only do not post Dr. Wilson&#x27;s materials as an integral part of your website; rather link to the article or study on the JesusWalk.com or JoyfulHeart.com website.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="study-card animate-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">Most of the religious paintings on the websites are out of copyright according to US law and may be freely used. Since we don&#x27;t own them, we can&#x27;t offer permission to use them. Dr. Wilson&#x27;s own watercolor paintings can be used for ministry with proper attribution, though do not use them on products without explicit written permission.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="study-card animate-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">The main text in our Bible studies is the NIV, since Dr. Wilson&#x27;s calling is to communicate the Word with clarity to the largest number of readers. However, in the numerous Hebrew and Greek word studies, he always refers to the KJV translation, as well as the NIV, the NASB, and, more recently, the ESV.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="study-card animate-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">Some churches teach that the KJV is the only legitimate English translation (though this argument is becoming less common). However, as a student of the Bible for more than 70 years, Dr. Wilson has found that the ESV is to be preferred for word-for-word accuracy these days (and is similar in most readings to the NRSV). The NASB is a more literal translation than the ESV, but less readable. The NIV probably provides the best balance between readability and accuracy, hence its use in our Bible studies.More....</p>

        <div class="study-card animate-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">Dr. Wilson subscribes to theStatement of Faith of the National Association of Evangelicals, and strongly believes in theinspiration and authority of the Scriptures.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="study-card animate-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">Dr. Wilson is sometimes able to take an occasional simple question via e-mail. However, the best way to find an answer is to use thesearch pageof the website to ask your question. That should get you most answers quickly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="study-card animate-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">Unfortunately, we can&#x27;t. Printing and mailing are both quite expensive and would require a large staff, which we can&#x27;t afford. We are able to give away free Bible studies via e-mail, since our costs are low. But we can&#x27;t provide printed Bible studies via postal mail.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="study-card animate-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">We get many, many requests for help. Pastors are suffering from diseases that need treatment. A church is trying to support orphans. Another is building a building to worship in. Yet another needs to purchase property. There are many, many needs that Christian workers and churches experience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="study-card animate-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">Please understand that Joyful Heart Renewal Ministries is essentially a one-person ministry by a retired pastor. What wecangive away are tens of thousands of free Bible studies via e-mail. No cost. But we don&#x27;t raise funds to help all the needs out there. Other ministries have this as their focus. Our focus is making high quality, in-depth Bible studies available free of change.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="study-card animate-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">Ultimately, God is our Provider, Jehovah-Jireh. Paul taught: &quot;And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus&quot; (Philippians 4:19).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="study-card animate-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">Unfortunately, no. Many, many churches in developing countries are in desperate need of printed materials to help spread the gospel and teach their people. However, due to the costs of printing and shipping, we can&#x27;t offer printed materials. We have no supply of  books stacked in some room or warehouse. Paperback book orders are only produced on a &#x27;Print on Demand&#x27; (POD) basis. Only when an order comes in, the book is printed on a special press and sent directly to the purchaser. Thus, there is no money tied up in stock. We are able to give away free e-mail Bible studies, but not printed materials.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="study-card animate-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">There is a tremendous need for Bibles in the language of the people in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere! However, our ministry is giving away free e-mail Bible studies, not Bibles. Some organizations specialize in providing Bibles. Ours does not.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="study-card animate-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">Dr. Wilson is often asked to travel to Africa or Asia at his expense and speak. He did travel five times to western Kenya to train pastors when he was younger. However, now that he is over 80, he no longer has energy needed for preaching missions and the international travel.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="study-card animate-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">We are honored by the request, but this is a Bible study ministry, not an organization that helps recognize, validate, or provide support for churches (other than by our free e-mail Bible studies). Please do not use the name of our ministry or Bible study series in your church&#x27;s advertising. These are proprietary.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="study-card animate-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">We don&#x27;t keep good track of American colleges, though there are some very fine ones. Nor do we provide scholarships or pay for someone&#x27;s education, no matter how worthy. Our focus is on providing free Bible study materials via e-mail.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="study-card animate-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">When we receive a prayer request via e-mail, we pray for the request before deleting the e-mail. But we do not keep lists of prayer requests for future prayers.</p>
