        <p>14And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.15And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD: &quot;O LORD, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.16Give ear, O Lord, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; listen to the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God.</p>

        <p>17&quot;It is true, O LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste these nations and their lands.18They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by men&#x27;s hands.19Now, O LORDour God, deliver us from his hand, so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone, O LORD, are God.&quot;</p>
        <p>1In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, &quot;This is what the Lord says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover.&quot;</p>
        <p>2Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,3&quot;Remember, O LORD, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes.&quot; And Hezekiah wept bitterly.</p>
        <p>4Before Isaiah had left the middle court, the word of the LORDcame to him:5&quot;Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people, &#x27;This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will heal you. On the third day from now you will go up to the temple of the LORD.6I will add fifteen years to your life. And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David.&#x27; &quot;</p>

        <p>7Then Isaiah said, &quot;Prepare a poultice of figs.&quot; They did so and applied it to the boil, and he recovered.</p>
        <p>Imagine the scene. The Assyrian army, the most powerful military force on earth, is ravaging the countryside a few miles away, threatening weaker cities into submission and destroying the rest, carting away their riches and levying a burdensome annual tax that bleeds the nation even more. Hundreds of thousands of enemy soldiers are within a two or three days march.</p>
        <p>You are Hezekiah, king of Judah, caught in the middle. Your capital is the fortress city of Jerusalem, high on the mountain chain that bisects Palestine. Stress is your daily companion. One report follows another of a city breached and burned, another cowed into submission. None is able to stand before the Assyrian army.</p>
        <p>Your people quail in fear, many calling for you to submit to Assyrians. &quot;Resistance is hopeless,&quot; they cry. &quot;You&#x27;ll get us all killed.&quot; Yet you are a believer in Yahweh, the true God. &quot;He will save us,&quot; you tell your people. Times couldn&#x27;t be more desperate, more bleak, more filled with violence. How do you pray in a time like this? What do you say to God?</p>
        <p>Judah was a relatively small country caught between the nutcracker of Assyria (present-day Iraq) and the Egyptians, who encouraged rebellion against Assyria. While the dating and order of events of this time period are confusing,1here is the gist of what is going on.</p>
        <p>The Assyrians controlled the countries to the north and west of Judah. Previous Assyrian kings had attacked the Northern Kingdom of Samaria -- Tiglath Pileser III (745-727 BC), Shalmanezer V (727-722), and Sargon II (722-705). Samaria finally fell in 722 BC and the Northern Kingdom ceased to exist (2 Kings 17:3-6; 18:9-12). The Assyrian kings also conquered Philistine cities west of Judah and imposed a tribute upon Hezekiah&#x27;s father.</p>

        <p>Hezekiah ascended the throne as King of Judah and began his sole reign at age 25 in 716/15, reigning 29 years until his death in 687. He was one of Judah&#x27;s only &quot;righteous and just&quot; kings, bringing about a number of reforms during his reign. He was known as one who &quot;trusted in the Lord&quot; (18:5), &quot;held fast&quot; and followed him (18:6), with the result that the Lord was with him (18:7) and gave him victory (18:8). Some of his religious reforms included:</p>
        <p>When Sargon II conquered the Philistine city of Ashdod in 711, Hezekiah avoided war. But when Assyrian troops departed, Hezekiah began to assert independence. &quot;He rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him&quot; (1 Kings 18:7). He stopped paying tribute and expanded Judah&#x27;s influence by attacking Philistine cities as far as Gaza that were allies of Assyria (18:8). Hezekiah was one of the chief ringleaders in a rebellion against Assyria.</p>
        <p>In 701 BC, another Assyrian king Sennacherib (705-681) led a massive military force into the area to put down the rebels, counteract Egyptian threats, and reassert Assyria&#x27;s dominance. Anticipating conflict with Assyria, Hezekiah had taken a number of steps:</p>
        <p>The Assyrian armies crushed the rebels in Phoenicia and the Philistine coastal cities. Then they turned inland. They couldn&#x27;t allow Judah&#x27;s rebellious tendencies to weaken their dominance of the area, which they needed to control as a buffer against their arch-enemy Egypt. Judah&#x27;s walled cities were conquered and many of its villages given as punishment and political favors to loyal vassals in Philistia. Finally, Jerusalem was besieged and Hezekiah was forced to admit his rebellion and pay a huge tribute to lift the siege. Assyrian records from Sennacherib gloat over the victory:</p>
        <p>The scripture records the humiliating conclusion:</p>
        <p>But the Assyrians felt after this that they had made a tactical error leaving Jerusalem unconquered. Sennacherib, encamped at Lachish a few miles south, sent his field commander (&quot;Rabshakeh,&quot; KJV, NRSV) with a large army to Jerusalem again. He threatened and belittled Hezekiah and insulted Yahweh himself:</p>
        <p>The prophet Isaiah reassured Hezekiah, and the Assyrian army withdrew to fight the Egyptians (2 Kings 19:9). Then a letter came to Hezekiah demanding that he surrender Jerusalem. We&#x27;ll pause now and consider Hezekiah&#x27;s prayer in verses 14-19.</p>
        <p>When Hezekiah receives the letter, he brings it before the Lord and spreads it out for God to read. He reads it to God and observes that the insult is to the living God far more than it is to Hezekiah himself. This is God&#x27;s insult and demand&#x27;s God&#x27;s response.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Hezekiah had encouraged the people with his own confidence in the greatness of the power of the unseen God:</p>
        <p>It sounds much like Elisha&#x27;s assurance to his servant at the siege of Dothan, where they are surrounded by the horses and chariots of fire of the Lord&#x27;s army: &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid... Those who are with us are more than those who are with them&quot; (2 Kings 6:16). In the New Testament, John writes: &quot;The one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.&quot; (1 John 4:4)</p>
        <p>It is vital to understand that Hezekiah is bringing God&#x27;s problem to God, rather than trying to solve it himself. The principle is: &quot;The Battle Is the Lord&#x27;s!&quot; This is not an excuse to do nothing. Hezekiah has made all the military preparations he can, but now is the time to look to the Lord. Consider:</p>
        <p>Think of the pressure we take upon ourselves when we try to be the general in God&#x27;s battles. We get discouraged. We give up. We fold our tents and go home. We can&#x27;t handle it. But when we actually believe that the battle is the Lord&#x27;s to fight, then we lethimbe the general and just follow his orders. Yes, we&#x27;re under the stress of battle, but not the stress of trying to play God.</p>
        <p>Hezekiah brings the letter before the Lord and begins his prayer.</p>
        <p>This corresponds to the magnificent opening of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, &quot;Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.&quot; Hezekiah begins his prayer with an awesome vision of who God really is.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Enthroned between the cherubim.&quot;</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth.&quot;</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;You have made heaven and earth.&quot;</blockquote>
        <p>Look at his prayer one more time:</p>
        <p>&quot;O LORD, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.16Give ear, O Lord, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; listen to the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God.</p>
        <p>17&quot;It is true, O LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste these nations and their lands.18They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by men&#x27;s hands.19Now, O LORDour God, deliver us from his hand, so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone, O LORD, are God.&quot; (19:15-19)</p>
        <p>The actual petition is quite brief: &quot;Deliver us from his hand!&quot; The basis of Hezekiah&#x27;s appeal is that God be seen by the nations as the only true God.</p>
        <p>The answer was not long in coming through Isaiah the prophet:</p>
        <p>After a poetic oracle or prophecy, the narrator recounts:</p>
        <p>God answered Hezekiah&#x27;s prayer, but then another crisis loomed.</p>
        <p>The timing of the illness, &quot;in those days,&quot; can&#x27;t be determined exactly,4but it may well have taken place around 701 BC at the time of Sennacharib&#x27;s campaign. From God&#x27;s response to Hezekiah&#x27;s prayer through the Prophet Isaiah (20:6b), it sounds like Sennacharib&#x27;s presence was still threatening Jerusalem at this time. What a time to fall ill and die! What a difficult time this would have been to leave his country leaderless!</p>
        <p>Hezekiah mortal illness involved a boil (20:7), Hebrewshehîn, &quot;boil, enflamed spot.&quot;5This may have been a furuncle or carbuncle, the latter being &quot;a more extensive inflammation of the skin, usually attended by a lowering of bodily resistance, and it can prove fatal.&quot;6To us, most infections are easily cured with antibiotics, but in those days, a serious infection could bring death.</p>
        <p>You may think it cruel to tell Hezekiah to &quot;Put your house in order,&quot; but it was really a kindness. It is likely that he had no clear successor at that point. If this took place in 701, it was before his son Manasseh was born. Hezekiah needed to name a successor so leadership would pass to another at his death without palace intrigues and unnecessary disruption to the kingdom.</p>
        <p>The Lord said, &quot;You will die; you will not recover&quot; (20:1b), but that didn&#x27;t happen. Why? When we considered Moses&#x27; intercession in Exodus 32, we discussed the interplay between God&#x27;s judgment and human response. Without any change in the situation, God&#x27;s word stands. But with a different human response, the outcome can be different, though all within the boundaries of God&#x27;s will. Vitringa, an eighteenth century Dutch scholar, put it this way:</p>
        <p>But Hezekiahdidrespond in prayer and faith, and God changed his mind. Let&#x27;s examine Hezekiah&#x27;s short prayer.</p>
        <p>The common English translations of the adjective describing Hezekiah&#x27;s weeping do us a disservice. &quot;Bitterly&quot; (NIV, NRSV) and &quot;sore&quot; (KJV) suggest a wrong attitude on Hezekiah&#x27;s part where the text doesn&#x27;t imply any. The adjective isgādōl, &quot;great,&quot; indicating &quot;many&quot; in number and other intensified concepts like &quot;loudness&quot; in sound, being old in years,&quot; etc.8A good translation in this context is &quot;profusely.&quot; Hezekiah wept a lot; he wept profusely.</p>
        <p>What kind of a baby is Hezekiah? Isn&#x27;t it interesting how we westerners tend to see tears as a sign of weakness in a man? &quot;Real men don&#x27;t cry,&quot; is the way we train our sons. It&#x27;s part of the macho exterior that men try to project. But in Hezekiah&#x27;s culture, men were able to admit and express their emotions openly. It was no shame to cry when under stress.</p>
        <p>Was Hezekiah terrified of death? Was he a faithless whiner? Certainly he did not look forward to death with the same longing as Paul, who saw it as &quot;far better&quot; (Philippians 1:23). But it is unfair to judge him byourknowledge this side of the cross. Hezekiah didn&#x27;t know about eternal life in the presence of God; it was a later revelation.</p>
        <p>His tears probably represent more than a fear of death. As mentioned above, it is likely that he had no heir yet, no one to carry on the line of Davidic kings promised centuries before that would culminate in a Messiah (2 Samuel 7:11-16). Hezekiah was a godly man who hoped in God. Young suggests: &quot;Hezekiah could well be facing the same temptation that came to Abraham when he was commanded to offer up his son (Genesis 22:1)&quot;9-- that is, the conflict of God&#x27;s promise concerning his offspring with God&#x27;s command that seemed to conflict with the promise.</p>
        <p>What does it mean, &quot;Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord....&quot;? Is this a childish, petulant response to an unwelcome word from God&#x27;s prophet? I don&#x27;t think so.</p>
        <p>He is in his own bedroom, probably hovered over by various counselors, officers, and physicians who are concerned at the impending death of this strong and godly king. To be alone with God that he might pray with some privacy and without interruption, he turns to the wall. God has been his help in crisis many times. He turns to God now in earnest and heartfelt prayer. His tears are tears of emotion and struggle. You&#x27;ve been there. You know. Hezekiah is a human, weakened by illness, facing the heavy responsibilities of defending his nation against its enemies. In addition, now he faces death and the burden of succession.</p>
        <p>&quot;Prayed&quot; ispālal, &quot;intervene, interpose, pray,&quot; the most common Hebrew root for prayer and praying, the verb occurring 84 times in the Old Testament. Though the exact derivation of the root is a matter of conjecture, both the verb and the noun (tepillâ, 20:5) refer most often to intercessory prayer.10Here he petitions God strongly for his own life, but because of his position and responsibility, he also prays for his nation&#x27;s uncertain future -- under military pressure, leaderless, and without a successor that can inspire national unity and resistance.</p>
        <p>His prayer seems short, but he knows God well by this time in his life, and in its shortness and abbreviation of expression much is implied:</p>
        <p>You may think it naive of Hezekiah to appeal to God on the basis of his own righteousness. After all, everyone sins. But his righteousness is not only his own judgment, but the judgment of the inspired writer of Kings, who tells us:</p>
        <p>Why does Hezekiah say what he does? I believe he is appealing to God&#x27;s promises to David concerning his son Solomon and Solomon&#x27;s offspring:</p>
        <p>God promised an unbroken line of David&#x27;s sons upon the throne. Hezekiah is also appealing to God&#x27;s promises for offspring and for a long life to those who walk uprightly before him:</p>
        <p>Hezekiah, I am sure, had not reached sinless perfection, but he had been careful (unlike his father) to live a godly, righteous, and faithful life before the Lord. He had been zealous for the Lord, in the face of much pressure and criticism from idolaters. He had encouraged the people with confidence and trust in God when threatened by his enemies. Hezekiah not onlytalkedabout a righteous life. Helivedit! He walked the walk!</p>
        <p>Hezekiah appealed to God&#x27;s promises for an heir and for long life for those who live a righteous life. God heard and answered quickly:</p>
        <p>Wow! God&#x27;s answer is both amazing and wonderful. A saint of God prays and immediately God both changes his mind and sends alternate instructions to his prophet. A few minutes after Hezekiah prays, Isaiah returns to his bedroom. Hezekiah is still lying on his side facing the wall. Isaiah says: &quot;Hezekiah, this is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says....&quot; Hezekiah turns over with wonder and joy on his face.</p>
        <p>According to Pliny, figs were used for the cure of ulcers.11Did the poultice of figs cure Hezekiah? It was probably instrumental, but only because God enabled it. Prior to this, Hezekiah was about to die and no figs would have helped. It is God who turned the situation around! Within three days Hezekiah would be strong enough to get out of bed and to go up to the temple (verse 6d).</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve heard people accuse Hezekiah of selfishness in his prayer for healing. The result of his prayer, this argument contends, is the birth of Manasseh, the worst king Judah had ever seen. If Hezekiah hadn&#x27;t asked for healing, Manasseh would never have been born. Be careful what you pray for!</p>
        <p>This argument is specious and weak.</p>
        <p>God chose to answer Hezekiah&#x27;s prayer and to bless him during his lifetime. Let&#x27;s not confuse this by second-guessing.</p>
        <p>From God&#x27;s response through Isaiah we get some hints to the reasons why God seems to have responded to Hezekiah&#x27;s prayer, though we can&#x27;t read God&#x27;s mind:</p>
        <p>You, dear friend, are also loved by God. He has redeemed you by the blood of Jesus, which cannot be valued because it is so costly. He has made promises to you. He has encouraged you to pray to him. You may not be a king, but you have influence important to the kingdom. I encourage you to pray.</p>
        <p>I also encourage you to consider personal holiness. Sometimes God answers the prayers of rank sinners and backslidden Christians. But his ear is particularly open to his children who seek to be obedient to him.</p>
        <p>Consider your own children&#x27;s petitions. When your child is being openly rebellious, are you quick to respond to his demands? No, you withhold everything except the necessities so your actions aren&#x27;t construed as rewarding disobedience. But when your child is compliant and obedient -- and asks for something special -- you think twice about saying no. You want to say yes. And if it won&#x27;t hurt him, you&#x27;ll often give it to him.</p>
        <p>This doesn&#x27;t mean you must be sinless to get your prayers answered. Hezekiah wasn&#x27;t sinless (2 Chronicles 32:26). He had made mistakes, wrong decisions, and had moments that reflect a weakness of faith. But Hezekiah made an honest attempt to follow God in his life and repented when he was convicted of his sin. God honored this with blessing, success, and answered prayer.</p>
        <p>In no way do I want to imply that God owes us anything, that salvation is by works rather than grace. This isn&#x27;t a works-righteousness mentality. It&#x27;s just good heavenly parenting. All God&#x27;s gifts are by grace -- his own favor towards us, which is neither earned nor deserved.</p>
        <p>But Goddoeshonor the prayers of the upright over those of the backslidden. James teaches us: &quot;The prayer of arighteous manis powerful and effective&quot; (James 5:16b).</p>
        <p>What do I learn from Hezekiah&#x27;s example of a prayer that God will answer? God&#x27;s heart is open to the prayer of his child seeking to live a faithful, upright, righteous life. Since God has less need for discipline, he has greater freedom to grant us answers to our prayers without hurting us.</p>
        <p>Can you pray Hezekiah&#x27;s simple prayer? &quot;Remember, O LORD, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes.&quot; I hope so.</p>
        <p>Father, help us to move from being unruly children to the place where you don&#x27;t need to discipline us so much. Help us to be like your servant Hezekiah, who trusted in you and your promises with all his heart, and wasn&#x27;t afraid to ask you for what he needed. Help us grow. In Jesus&#x27; name, we pray. Amen.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD: &#x27;O LORD, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth.
