        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;You havesold yourselfto do what is evil in the sight of the LORD.&quot; (1 Kings 21:20).[1]</blockquote>

        <p>What does he mean -- sell yourself? In ancient times, you might sell merchandise, crops, and land. But you could also voluntarily sell yourself as a slave to pay your debts.[2]Ahab &quot;sells himself to do evil&quot; when he embraces Jezebel&#x27;s Baal worship, but it comes at a cost -- and Ahab does not escape the final consequences of his evil.</p>
        <p>We have similar idioms in modern English.</p>
        <p>Selling oneself is a transactional concept. You do something that helps you now, but there is a cost to that decision. You do something crooked that makes you rich or helps you avoid taxes, but you lose something much more precious -- your integrity and righteousness. When you sell your soul, you sell yourself. You end up belonging to another. You are now enslaved, no longer free, forced to do another&#x27;s bidding. Ahab (in our text) gambles by selling himself and loses big time.</p>
        <p>This concept of enslavement by sin is found throughout the New Testament. Jesus says,</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin.&quot; (John 8:34)</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?&quot; (Romans 6:16)</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved.&quot; (2 Peter 2:19b)</blockquote>
        <p>Even those on the edges of the Christian faith, perhaps believers, can fall into &quot;the snare of the devil, being captured by him to do his will&quot; (2 Timothy 2:26).</p>
        <p>Sometimes we underestimate the power of sin, and so we dabble in things that we know are wrong, being so naïve as to believe that there is no real cost, no downside to sinning so long as we don&#x27;t get caught. We imagine that sin can&#x27;t overpower a child of God.</p>
        <p>God describes sin to Cain as a patient predator.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.&quot; (Genesis 4:7)</blockquote>
        <p>The idea here seems to be of a lion lying in wait, &quot;lurking&quot; (NRSV) just outside your door, waiting for you to let it in.[4]Lions were loose in the land of Israel, dangerous to both man and beast. Peter says, &quot;Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour&quot; (1 Peter 5:8).</p>
        <p>Sin deceives. It doesn&#x27;t look that bad. Just a little won&#x27;t hurt you. But sin corrupts your soul. Peter says that sin &quot;wages war against your soul&quot; (1 Peter 2:11). Sin takes you onto the wrong path, the wide path that leads to destruction. Satan, disguises himself, but his real nature is as a thief who &quot;comes only to steal and kill and destroy&quot; (John 10:10a).</p>
        <p>But sin doesn&#x27;t have the final word, nor do we. Jesus does.</p>
        <p>In the Old Testament, a close relative could redeem a relative who had become enslaved because of debt. This kinsman-redeemer could reclaim family property that had been sold. The kinsman-redeemer could pay a debt on behalf of his family members. In the Book of Ruth, Boaz is an example of such a kinsman-redeemer.</p>
        <p>Jesus is our Kinsman-Redeemer. He humbles himself to become a man, born to a virgin in an obscure town in the hills of Judah (Philippians 2:6-8). And becoming a man, he becomes like us -- one of the human race. Yes, he is the Son of God, but he is also our Kinsman, our Brother.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;He had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.&quot; (Hebrews 2:17)</blockquote>
        <p>But the cost to redeem us from our slavery is exceedingly great. The Greek word grouplytroōrelates to paying a ransom, especially for the manumission or freeing of slaves.[5]</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;You wereransomed... not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot.&quot; (1 Peter 1:18-19)</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as aransomfor many.&quot; (Mark 10:45)</blockquote>
        <p>You may have gotten yourself enslaved by dabbling with sin. Or maybe you were enslaved because the enemy who took advantage of you, capturing a weak and unsuspecting victim, and reduced you to fear, addiction, hopelessness -- to the place where you think you&#x27;ll never be free again.</p>
        <p>I have good news. The jailer is coming back to your cell, unlocking the door.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Oh, someone came and paid your fine, made your bail. We can&#x27;t hold you any longer.&quot;</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;He says he is your brother.&quot;</blockquote>
        <p>You walk down the hall, and there he is waiting for you. And together you and Jesus walk out of that jail, that place of slavery</p>
        <p>You have been tempted. Perhaps you have &quot;sold yourself to do evil,&quot; like Ahab, I don&#x27;t know. But now you are free! Jesus your Kinsman-Redeemer frees you!</p>
        <p>Yes, you goof up. You may be tempted to ditch Jesus from time to time, and disappear for a few hours or a few days. But you know that this only leads to a renewal of your slavery. So you learn walk with Jesus at his pace. You know that by yourself, you&#x27;re vulnerable, but with him at your side, you stay free.</p>
        <p>We arefreedbecause Jesus paid for our sins through his death on the cross on our behalf. But westay freeby walking with him.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, andthe truth will set you free.&quot;[6](John 8:31-32)</blockquote>
        <p>The word &quot;abide&quot; (Greekmenō) is key to our understanding of this verse. It is variously translated &quot;abide&quot; (ESV), &quot;continue&quot; (NRSV, KJV), and &quot;hold to&quot; (NIV). The root idea is &quot;remain, stay.&quot;[7]</p>
        <p>God is our Shield, according to the Psalmist. He is our Fortress, our Hiding Place. By ourselves we are weak, vulnerable, subject to constant attack. But when stay or abide with Jesus, when we hang out with him we are safe. He is our Redeemer and Defender. And in him we find joy and peace.</p>
        <p>Friend, if you&#x27;ve never asked Jesus to forgive your sins and be your Savior -- the one who saves or rescues you -- then now is the time. But if you know him, and have strayed outside the Fortress and have been wounded by sin, even taken prisoner again, call out to him, and he&#x27;ll gladly rescue you afresh. He&#x27;s already paid to set you free from slavery. He&#x27;ll reassert that he has redeemed you, and you&#x27;ll be free again.</p>
        <p>Now, with Jesus at your side on this journey, he&#x27;ll help you walk free. From one former slave to another, that, truly, is Good News!</p>
