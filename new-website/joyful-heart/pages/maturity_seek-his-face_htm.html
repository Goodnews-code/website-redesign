        <p>David thoroughly enjoys the Lord. The first six verses of Psalm 105 are a great example of this.[1]He gives us 10 commands to turn our hearts to the Lord:</p>

        </figure>
        <p>But the command that stands out to me this morning as I read Psalm 105 is verse 4:</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Seek the LORD and his strength;seek his presence continually!&quot; (Psalm 105:4, ESV)</blockquote>
        <p>The passage contains three ideas: seeking diligently, seeking God&#x27;s presence, and doing so continually. Let&#x27;s spend a few moments pondering these:</p>
        <p>Two nearly synonymous Hebrew words are used to express the idea of seeking in verse 4. Each has a slightly different flavor.</p>
        <p>In our verse they serve as synonyms. These words are often used together in parallel in passages about seeking Yahweh.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;From [the places of your exile] you willseekthe LORD your Godand you will find him,if yousearch afterhim with all your heartand with all your soul.&quot; (Deuteronomy 4:29)</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Such is the generation of those whoseekhim,whoseekthe face of the God of Jacob.&quot; (Psalm 24:6)</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;... those who have turned back from following the LORD,who do notseekthe LORDorinquireof him.&quot; (Zephaniah 1:6)</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Seekthe LORD, all you humble of the land,who do his just commands;seekrighteousness;seekhumility;perhaps you may be hiddenon the day of the anger of the LORD.&quot; (Zephaniah 2:3)</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Seekthe LORD while he may be found;call upon him while he is near....&quot; (Isaiah 55:6)</blockquote>
        <p>When you seek someone, you look diligently until you find him or her. Jesus gives us three parables of seeking something lost -- the lost sheep, the lost coin, the lost son (Luke 15).</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;What woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it?&quot; (Luke 15:8)</blockquote>
        <p>There is an urgency, a diligence, a single determination about seeking. A refusal to give up. A willingness to leave 99 sheep and scour the hillsides until you find that one lost sheep. A single focus that drives you. We are to seek the Lord with such diligence!</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Seek the LORD and his strength;seek his presence continually!&quot; (Psalm 105:4, ESV)</blockquote>
        <p>Three objects are given in this verse:</p>
        <p>We are to seek the Lord Yahweh himself. Not for what he can do for us, but for who HeIS.</p>
        <p>And we are to seek his strength, as well. So often we rely on our own strength. My three-year-old granddaughter insists that she wants to &quot;do it myself!&quot; without help or assistance. And that&#x27;s good, part of growing up. But often, as adults, our pride keeps us from calling on God. Like immature children, we think we know it all. Asking for help would demonstrate that we aren&#x27;t self-sufficient, and so we refuse to -- that is, until we become humbled enough by circumstances that we are willing to seek Jesus&#x27; help when we need it.</p>
        <p>Then, in Psalm 105:4, David urges us to seek God&#x27;s presence. The Hebrew word ispânîym. ESV and NRSV translate it &quot;presence,&quot; while the NIV and KJV use the more literal, &quot;face.&quot; In Hebrew thought, the face is often a substitute for the self or the feelings of the self. So &quot;to hide one&#x27;s face&quot; is to show aversion or disgust. &quot;To turn away the face&quot; is to reject. &quot;To raise the face&quot; is to show favor, respect, importance. For one&#x27;s face to &quot;shine&quot; is to smile. In the Aaronic blessing, we read:</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;The LORD bless you and keep you;The LORD make hisfaceto shine upon youand be gracious to you;the LORD lift up hiscountenanceupon youand give you peace.&quot; (Numbers 6:24-26, ESV)</blockquote>
        <p>The expression &quot;face to face&quot; denotes close, personal contact. Jacob wrestled with Yahweh and saw him &quot;face to face&quot; (Genesis 32:30).</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;The LORD used to speak to Moses face to face,as a man speaks to his friend.&quot; (Exodus 33:11a)</blockquote>
        <p>So the face of God indicates his intimate presence. Frankly, I envy Moses!</p>
        <p>We are commanded in Psalm 105:4 to &quot;seek his face,&quot; his presence. Seek it diligently, with all our heart. David cries out:</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.When shall I come and behold the face of God?&quot; (Psalm 42:2, NRSV)</blockquote>
        <p>The third idea in Psalm 105:4 is that we are to seek the Lord, his strength, and his intimate and immediate presencecontinually. The Hebrew noun istāmîd, &quot;continuity, continuance, unceasingness,&quot; here used as an adverb, &quot;continually.&quot;[5]</p>
        <p>We don&#x27;t just seek the intimate presence of the Lord once or occasionally, but constantly, continually, unceasingly. We seek him in our working and in our playing, in our struggles and in our joys. Our seeking his presence is an unremitting desire. We can never have enough.</p>
        <p>How about you, my friend. Are you reaching out to him constantly? Are you satisfied with a prayer or a song, or are you unsatisfied until you sense his intimate presence as well? Are you thirsty for him, like David? (Psalm 42:2). Are you desperate for him like Paul? (&quot;....that I may know him,&quot; Philippians 3:10). We are willing to be so superficial with God for so much of our time, of our lives.</p>
        <p>God, change us! Fill us anew, O God, with a fresh love, a holy hunger, that we might seek your intimate presence continually, always, with all our hearts and souls, with all our mind and strength! Grant it in us, oh, God. In Jesus&#x27; name we pray. Amen.</p>

Copps says,dārash&quot;is distinguished from its frequent parallel and equivalentbāqashinasmuch as it 1. means &quot;to seek with care,&quot; 2. is often cognitive (its end is &quot;to know&quot;), and 3. seldom governs an infinitive.
