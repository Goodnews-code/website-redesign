        <p>The Apostle Paul writes, &quot;Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed&quot; (1 Corinthians 5:7), echoing the early church&#x27;s belief that Christ was a fulfillment of the Passover or Paschal lamb (from Hebrewpesach, &quot;passover&quot;).</p>
        <p>As I study the New Testament, I am becoming more and more convinced that Jesus, too, saw himself in this role, and implies as much in his words at the Last Supper -- which, it turns out, were shared in the context of an actual Passover meal. Let&#x27;s explore this aspect of Christ&#x27;s ministry of atonement as the Passover Lamb. To do this, we need to go back thirteen or fourteen centuries before Christ to the people of Israel when they were slaves in Egypt.</p>
        <p>As God begins to deliver Israel from Egypt, he sends Moses to Pharaoh with the demand, &quot;Let my people go!&quot; Pharaoh refuses. Following each refusal, God sends plagues of increasing severity upon Egypt, culminating with God&#x27;s decree that each firstborn son in Egypt would be slain (Exodus 11:5). But when Moses declares God&#x27;s words to Pharaoh, Pharaoh refuses to believe them.</p>
        <p>To protect from this plague the Israelites who lived in Egypt, God instructs Moses that each household should select a yearling male lamb and slaughter it at dusk on the 14th day of Abib (the Hebrew month that corresponds with March-April).</p>

        <p>During the night the angel of death passes through Egypt slaying the firstborn of both men and animals to bring judgment on Pharaoh and the gods of Egypt.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;When the LORDgoes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over (pasach) that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down&quot; (Exodus 12:23)</blockquote>
        <p>The Hebrew verb used in these verses ispāsach. While there are several theories about the meaning of this verb, two seem most plausible. The traditional etymology is the meaning &quot;to pass (over),&quot;1that is, the merciful passing over of a destructive power. Some interpretpāsachas meaning &quot;to defend, protect,&quot; that is, &quot;the Lord will protectively cover the houses of the Israelites and will not allow the destroyer to enter.&quot;2In either case, the blood is a sign to the Lord that the house that bears it should be exempted from the judgment on the firstborn.</p>
        <p>Just what kind of sacrifice is the initial Paschal lamb offered at the Exodus? It is not like the scapegoat on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16) or one of the morning and evening offerings (Exodus 29:38-43; Numbers 28:1-8). Most of these offerings were to atone for sin in some sense, while the commemorative sacrifice of Passover lambs in the temple each year was not considered as an atonement for sin.3</p>
        <p>But what was the significance of the initial sacrifice of Passover lambs at thefirstPassover? Five offerings were performed in the tabernacle and, later, in the temple.4Of these, Old Testament scholar Richard Averbeck observes that the sacrifice of the Passover lamb bears some resemblance to the peace or fellowship offering. In this type of offering, a representative piece of meat is offered before the Lord and to the priests. The rest is eaten by the offerer and his family as a kind of celebration meal -- similar to the celebration meal of the Passover. Averbeck also notes similarities between the original Passover act of placing blood on the doorpost and lintel and the ordination of priests, where blood is placed on the priest&#x27;s ear, right thumb, and right big toe as an act of consecration (Leviticus 8:23-24). He sees the initial Passover offering as a consecration or setting apart of the people within each household who partook of the sacrifice.5</p>
        <p>Israel&#x27;s sin doesn&#x27;t seem to be in the forefront; rather, the lamb seems to be a kind of substitute or interposition for the firstborn males and animals in the household. However, there may be some idea of expiation or purification present since hyssop is used to smear the blood. Elsewhere hyssop is associated with expiation and purification.6In addition, some Rabbinical writings refer to the redemptive effect of the blood of the Passover lamb.7</p>

        <p>Jews were instructed to partake of the Passover annually to celebrate and commemorate God redeeming them from slavery in Egypt. By Jesus&#x27; day, Passover was to be celebrated only within the precincts of Jerusalem, so the city was jam-packed with pilgrims during this season.</p>
        <p>There is some question whether the Last Supper Jesus held with his disciples was a Passover meal or a special meal the day before Passover. The Synoptic Gospels are pretty clear that the Last Supper was a Passover meal (Mark 14:12; Luke 22:13-15), but the chronology of John&#x27;s Gospel seems to indicate that Jesus was crucified just before Passover began (John 18:28). These can probably be harmonized by assuming the use of different calendars among the Jews.8However, I&#x27;m convinced that the Last Supper was indeed held on Passover as part of the Passover meal.</p>
        <p>Let&#x27;s look at some of the elements of the Passover meal as it might have been held in Jesus&#x27; day:9Each element of the meal was blessed and then commented upon (thehaggadah) by the head of the household, in this case, Jesus.</p>
        <p>This was a very special meal, since neither wine nor meat were common as everyday fare. Here is a reconstruction of the meal based on the research of New Testament scholar Joachim Jeremias.10</p>
        <p>If this outline of the Passover meal at the Last Supper is accurate, then Jesus&#x27; words about the bread being his body and the cup being his blood are immediately adjacent to eating the Passover lamb. I can&#x27;t escape the conclusion that Jesus&#x27; words were interpreted by his disciples -- and probably intended by Jesus -- to be understood in relation to the Passover and the Passover lamb.11Clearly the early church thought of Jesus as the Passover or Paschal Lamb that had been sacrificed (1 Corinthians 5:7). Perhaps the analogy is: Jesus interposes himself to redeem his people from their bondage to sin, just as the Passover lamb was interposed to redeem the people of Israel from slavery in Egypt.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s pretty clear that what we call Jesus&#x27; &quot;words of institution&quot; use clear sacrificial language.</p>
        <p>The words of institution are found with some variations in Matthew 26:26-28, Mark 14:22-24; Luke 22:19-20; and 1 Corinthians 11:24-25. While I can&#x27;t be exhaustive, let&#x27;s briefly examine Matthew&#x27;s account. Most striking to me in this passage are Jesus words: &quot;This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.&quot;</p>
        <p>This would be startling to anyone, especially to Jews who were prohibited from drinking blood (Leviticus 17:10-11). In John 6:53-57 such offensive words caused some disciples to leave Jesus and no longer follow him (John 6:66). Coupled with Jesus asking the disciples to eat bread that he identified as his body, we have a remarkable and powerful image. Jesus is asking his disciples to feed on him (John 6:57) and unite themselves to him and to his death using a very intimate and powerful figure. How could the disciples forget such a vivid idea? They couldn&#x27;t. Jesus intended that they remember.</p>
        <p>Though the original manuscripts of Matthew&#x27;s Gospel may have omitted the word &quot;new,&quot; the concept of a new covenant was surely in his mind. The concept of the &quot;blood of the covenant&quot; is found in Exodus 27:7-8, where blood is sprinkled over the people of Israel when they agree to the original covenant they were making with Yahweh at the foot of Mt. Sinai. But the Prophet Jeremiah heralded the coming of a new covenant of forgiveness of sins replacing the Mosaic covenant:</p>
        <p>As mentioned in Lesson 2 of this series, the phrase &quot;for many&quot; points back to Isaiah 53:11-12, where the Servant &quot;bore the sin of many.&quot; Jesus uses the phrase &quot;poured out for many for the forgiveness of sin.&quot;</p>
        <p>To pour out blood in order to obtain forgiveness for another is clearly the concept of a blood sacrifice. In our day, some who are offended by this concept seek to reinterpret the meaning of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, but it&#x27;s pretty hard to hide the truth that Jesus intended it to remember his death as a sacrifice for sins.</p>
        <p>Here Jesus is referring to the Great Banquet alluded to in both the Old and New Testaments. The Jews of Jesus&#x27; day saw this as a final or eschatological Passover celebration with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and the other patriarchs and prophets (Luke 13:28-29; 14:15; 22:30; Revelation 19:9)</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed&quot; (1 Corinthians 5:7), and in the Lord&#x27;s Supper we are invited to partake not only of the sacrifice (see 1 Corinthians 10:16-18), but to celebrate both our redemption through Christ&#x27;s atonement and his coming again. The next time you have the privilege of partaking of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, remember and be thankful.</blockquote>
        <p>Just as the Passover lamb was interposed to redeem the people of Israel from slavery in Egypt, so Jesus interposes himself to redeem his people from their bondage to sin. Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.</p>
        <p>Father, thank you for the rich imagery of Christ as our Passover lamb. Thank you for his willingness to be sacrificed on our behalf. Thank you for the comfort and hope that we find in the Lord&#x27;s Supper. And thank you for the expectation we have of the final Banquet with you. In Jesus&#x27; name, we pray. Amen.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast -- as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.&quot; (1 Corinthians 5:7)</blockquote>
