        <p>I think I am drawn to Psalm 84 so strongly because the author has written a kind of love song, framed by the language of deep affection, penned by one who longs to be in God&#x27;s presence always. It is a hunger, a thirst, a longing, as he says in verse 2. Read the psalm, and then let&#x27;s talk about it.</p>

        <p>1How lovely is your dwelling place,O LORD of hosts!2My soul longs, yes, faintsfor the courts of the LORD;my heart and flesh sing for joyto the living God.3Even the sparrow finds a home,and the swallow a nest for herself,where she may lay her young,at your altars, O LORD of hosts,my King and my God.4Blessed are those who dwell in your house,ever singing your praise! Selah</p>
        <p>5Blessed are those whose strength is in you,in whose heart are the highways to Zion.6As they go through the Valley of Bacathey make it a place of springs;the early rain also covers it with pools.7They go from strength to strength;each one appears before God in Zion.8O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer;give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah</p>
        <p>9Behold our shield, O God;look on the face of your anointed!10For a day in your courtsis better than a thousand elsewhere.I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my Godthan dwell in the tents of wickedness.11For the LORD God is a sun and shield;the LORD bestows favor and honor.No good thing does he withholdfrom those who walk uprightly.12O LORD of hosts,blessed is the one who trusts in you!&quot; (Psalm 84:1-12, ESV)</p>

        <p>Who is this psalmist who longs for God&#x27;s presence. We get some clues from the inscription. He has intended the psalm to be sung in the temple, that&#x27;s clear. It is &quot;for the director of music.&quot; We don&#x27;t really know what &quot;according to gittith&quot; means, however, though it&#x27;s probably some kind of musical reference.1</p>
        <p>The psalmist is one &quot;of the sons of Korah,&quot; we&#x27;re told. These sons of Korah, these Korahites, were a clan of Levites who seemed to be a guild of temple singers. During a crisis in Jehoshaphat&#x27;s reign, we read,</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;And the Levites, of the Kohathites and the Korahites,stood up to praise the LORD, the God of Israel,with a very loud voice.&quot; (2 Chronicles 20:19)</blockquote>
        <p>The sons of Korah had various roles associated with temple worship. When they weren&#x27;t singing, they served as temple gatekeepers (1 Chronicles 9:19; 26:1, 19), as well as bakers of the temple showbread (1 Chronicles 9:31). The temple was their life.</p>
        <p>Like the priests, however, a Levite would served in the temple only a few weeks each year on some kind of rotating schedule.2During the months they were off duty, the Levites would return to their families in one of the Levitical towns in the countryside to earn their living through subsistence farming like most Israelites.</p>
        <p>When his group of temple workers is about to was called up for service in the temple, however, our psalmist begins to get excited. He loves his time in the temple.</p>

          <figcaption>Solomon&#x27;s Temple (unknown artist)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>And so comes the day when he and his kinsmen leave their village to journey together through the valleys and up the hills of the Judean highlands until they reached the Holy City. It is a beloved pilgrimage twice a year for temple service -- besides Passover and other festivals!</p>
        <p>Perhaps he is singing as he and his friends travel the dusty roads to Jerusalem. He begins:</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;How lovely is your dwelling place,O LORD of hosts!&quot; (Psalm 84:1)</blockquote>
        <p>It is the language of love -- &quot;How lovely!&quot; The Hebrew adjective comes from the verb &quot;to love,&quot; often used to express God&#x27;s great love for his people.3A related Hebrew verb is found throughout the Song of Solomon.4</p>
        <p>The temple is loved not primarily because it is grand -- though Solomon&#x27;s temple is amazing! The temple is loved because it considered is Yahweh&#x27;s earthly &quot;dwelling place.&quot;5When I was a boy I loved to go to my grandparents&#x27; house -- partly because it was different and exciting, but mainly because that is where my beloved grandparents lived.</p>
        <p>Notice the title the psalmist uses for God in verse 1: &quot;LORD of hosts&quot; (ESV, NRSV, KJV), &quot;LORD Almighty&quot; (NIV). &quot;Hosts&quot; is a military term --ṣebā&#x27;ôt, &quot;armies, hosts.&quot;6God is &quot;Yahweh of the angelic armies!&quot; You&#x27;ll remember this title from Martin Luther&#x27;s hymn, &quot;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God&quot;</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;... Lord Sabaoth is his name,From age to age the same,And He must win the battle.&quot;</blockquote>
        <p>But this isn&#x27;t the only time this title occurs, nor is it the only title. Yahwehṣebā&#x27;ôtoccurs four times in this brief psalm (verses 1, 3, 8, and 12). And when you begin to examine the psalm carefully, you see titles of God scattered throughout this love song -- more often and in greater variety than you would expect. Sixteen names and titles in only 12 verses!</p>
        <p>Why so often? Clearly, the psalmist delights in the grand and exalted titles of the Lord he loves. God&#x27;s name is always on his lips. More about this in my study,Names and Titles of God(JesusWalk Publications, 2010).</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;How lovely is your dwelling place,O LORD of hosts!&quot; (verse 1)</blockquote>
        <p>Now he reveals his deep feelings as he thinks about the temple.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;My soul longs, yes, faintsfor the courts of the LORD;my heart and flesh sing for joyto the living God.&quot; (Psalm 84:2)</blockquote>
        <p>Notice the emotional, even physical way the psalmist describes his love for God and a near proximity to his presence in the temple. His heart (his inner being) and his flesh (his body, his outer being) share in this longing for God. These are the verbs:</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;My soul longs, yes, faintsfor the courts of the LORD.&quot; (Psalm 84:2a)</blockquote>
        <p>The psalmist imagines the &quot;courts10of the Lord,&quot; that is, the various courtyards of Solomon&#x27;s temple.11The tabernacle in the wilderness had but one courtyard surrounded by posts and a cloth enclosure. Solomon&#x27;s temple was more complex. Two courts surrounded the actual temple structure. The Inner Court or Court of the Priests was separated from the space beyond by a wall of three courses of hewn stone, surmounted by cedar beams. The Great Court surrounded the whole temple where the people assembled to worship (1 Kings 6:36 7:9, 12; 2 Chronicles 4:9; Jeremiah 19:14; 26:2).12</p>
        <p>Now the psalmist remembers the birds that fill the temple courtyards with their chirpings and songs.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Even the sparrow finds a home,13and the swallow a nest for herself,where she may lay her young,at your altars,14O LORD of hosts,my King and my God.&quot; (Psalm 84:3-4)</blockquote>
        <p>While we&#x27;re not sure of the exact species, the words here are traditionally translated &quot;sparrow&quot; and &quot;swallow.&quot;15Sparrows, of course, peck for food on the floor of the courtyard flitting here and there. They build their nests on the ledges and parapets of the courtyard, finding twigs and grasses wherever they can. Swallows, on the other hand, are insect eaters, swooping with great speed around the open courts. Their nests are made of mud, grass and feathers, forming a sort of open cup shape under the eaves of the wall that surrounds the courtyard.</p>
        <p>The psalmist looks on the birds with special delight -- and not a little envy. After all, he can&#x27;t stay in the temple. His service might last for a week or two. But the sparrows and swallows get to live out their whole lives and raise their families in God&#x27;s house, near the sacred altar of Yahweh. Birds in the rest of Jerusalem and the surrounding country are at risk of capture for food. Bird eggs are considered a special delicacy. But within the temple precincts, the birds and their families can live unmolested, at peace.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Blessed are those who dwell16in your house,ever singing your praise! Selah.&quot;17(Psalm 84:4)</blockquote>
        <p>The birds are blessed, fortunate, to be envied,18because God&#x27;s house is their home, and the sparrows&#x27; songs fill the courtyard with their happy chirpings. The Levite choirs, such as our psalmist would be a part of, sing at prescribed times during the day and evening hours. &quot;Singing praise&quot; (ESV, NRSV), &quot;praising&quot; (NIV, KJV, NASB) is from the Hebrew verbhālalfrom which we get &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;19No rules govern when the birds may sing, however. Their melodies fill the temple grounds from dawn to dusk.</p>
        <p>In his mind&#x27;s eye the psalmist has been thinking about the glorious temple he knows so intimately as a temple worker. But now his thoughts shift to the journey from his small Levitical village, along the roads that lead to Jerusalem. It is a trip he has taken often. Not only his feet, but his heart also is on a pilgrimage to God&#x27;s House.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;5Blessed are those whose strength is in you,in whose heart are the highways [to Zion.]6As they go through the Valley of Bacathey make it a place of springs;the early rain also covers it with pools.7They go from strength to strength;each one appears before God in Zion.&quot; (Psalm 84:5-7)</blockquote>
        <p>He is thinking of God&#x27;s house as a place to focus his worship, but it is in Yahweh himself that he trusts.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Blessed are those whose strength is in you....&quot; (Psalm 84:5a)</blockquote>
        <p>It is way too easy for us humans to transfer our worship to things, to objects, to statues, to places, rather than to keep our focus on God himself. But the psalmist clearly makes that distinction here. Climbing the roads up the Judean hills is arduous, but he is trusting God for strength20for the journey. It is not just a physical pilgrimage. It is a pilgrimage of the heart.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;... in whose heart are the highways21[to Zion].22(ESV, NRSV)&quot;... who have set their hearts on pilgrimage.&quot; (NIV)&quot;... in whose heartarethe waysof them.&quot; (KJV)</blockquote>
        <p>Now the thought turns from the upward Jerusalem road to the terrain through which they are passing.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;As they go through the Valley of Bacathey make it a place of springs;the early rain also covers it with pools.&quot; (Psalm 84:6)</blockquote>
        <p>There&#x27;s lots of speculation about this &quot;Valley of Baca.&quot; Some see it as the Valley of Tears, deriving the nounbākāʾfrom the verbbākâ, &quot;to weep.&quot;23Others see it as a place of balsam trees (Hebrewbākāʾ), perhaps the Valley of Rephaim (2 Samuel 5:22-24; 1 Chronicles 14:14-15).244Oh, the sermon possibilities! More recently, scholars tend see this as merely a place name, ruining all the hermeneutic joys.</p>
        <p>To me, the most natural interpretation seems to suggest that the Valley of Baca (wherever it is) is an arid place that is transformed into a &quot;place of springs&quot;25and refreshing pools26where the pilgrims&#x27; strength is renewed.27</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;They go from strength to strength;28each one appears before God in Zion.&quot; (Psalm 84:7)</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;From strength to strength&quot; seems to be a Hebrew idiom that means something like &quot;the closer they get, the stronger they become&quot;29(see 2 Corinthians 3:18; Proverbs 4:18).</blockquote>
        <p>Finally, &quot;each one appears30before God31in Zion&quot;32(Psalm 84:7). The pilgrimage is over. They have arrived at their destination!</p>
        <p>Until now we have listened in on the psalmist&#x27;s anticipations of the Holy City and the pilgrimage to its gates. Now he presents his petition before God:</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;8O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer;give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah9Behold our shield, O God;look on the face of your anointed!&quot; (Psalm 84:8-9)</blockquote>
        <p>Notice his address to &quot;Yahweh, God of the armies&quot; and &quot;God of Jacob,&quot; some of the titles of God that appear in this psalm. His actual petition is for God to &quot;behold&quot; and &quot;look on&quot; a person. The words suggest going beyond seeing a person with one&#x27;s eyes, to looking upon him with favor,33as the NIV translation suggests: &quot;Look with favor upon your anointed one.&quot;</p>
        <p>The psalmist asks God to look with favor upon &quot;our shield&quot; in the first line, then upon &quot;your anointed&quot; in the second line that parallels the first. In its original context, this isn&#x27;t messianic. The psalmist is asking for God&#x27;s favor towards Jerusalem&#x27;s ruling monarch. &quot;Shield&quot; is used figuratively of the one who protects, sometimes of God (Psalm 3:3), but here of the king (Psalm 47:9; 89:18; Hosea 4:18).34&quot;Anointed&quot; ismāshîaḥ(from which we get our word, &quot;Messiah&quot;). Here it refers to the king who is anointed with oil as he is invested in his office (1 Samuel 10:1; 16:12; 2 Samuel 2:4; etc.).</p>
        <p>Ultimately, of course, Jesus the is the Prince of Peace who will reign in the Holy City -- Jerusalem, the &quot;City of Peace.&quot; Jesus is the Anointed One, the Messiah, the Son of God, the Son of Man who will reign over the Kingdom of God forever (Daniel 7:14). But for now, it is an earthly king for whom the psalmist requests help and mercy.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;10For a day in your courts35is better than a thousand elsewhere.I would rather be a doorkeeper36in the house of my Godthan dwell37in the tents of wickedness.&quot; (Psalm 84:10)</blockquote>
        <p>The psalmist&#x27;s heart turns again to the temple, the house of God, to which he contrasts &quot;the tents of wickedness.&quot; The Israelites had long since settled down to live in houses. &quot;Tent&quot; has now become an alternate or poetic term for &quot;house, dwelling.&quot;38The luxurious homes of those who have gained their wealth through nefarious means may tempt some, but the psalmist would rather be a humble servant in God&#x27;s glorious house, the temple. He considers just being here a high privilege indeed!</p>
        <p>Indeed, as a Levite of the clan of Korah, he probably is aliteral doorkeeperor guard at the temple gates (1 Chronicles 9:19; 26:1, 19). What a joy it is to him -- one day here in the courts of Yahweh&#x27;s temple is better than thousands of days any place else! What a privilege he has! Even though he knows that God is everywhere, omnipresent, here in the temple God&#x27;s presence seems that much more real to him.</p>
        <p>His thoughts now turn from the glories of the temple to God himself.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;11For the LORD God is a sun and shield;the LORD bestows39favor and honor.No good thing does he withholdfrom those who walk uprightly.12O LORD of hosts,blessed is the one who trusts in you!&quot; (Psalm 84:11-12)</blockquote>
        <p>It is remarkable that the psalmist can see so clearly beyond the glorious temple Solomon built at huge expense. Many people&#x27;s eyes are captured by objects -- great buildings, statues of the saints -- and cannot see beyond them to God himself.</p>
        <p>The psalmist now extols the wonders of Yahweh.</p>
        <p>So often we seek wealth and honor from the world. We pander to men and women who can advance us. But the real blessings, the ones that last, come only from our loving God.</p>
        <p>Again and again we see the back-and-forth between extoling God&#x27;s dwelling place and praising him directly.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;How lovely is your dwelling place ...My heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God&quot; (verses 1-2)</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Even the sparrow finds a home....Blessed are those who [are] ever singing your praise.&quot; (verses 3-4)</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Blessed are those whose strength is in you.&quot;They travel on pilgrimage until&quot;Each one appears before God in Zion.&quot; (verses 5-7)</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Hear my prayer....&quot;Look with favor upon our king (verse 8-9)</blockquote>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;A day in your courts&quot; gives way to praise of Yahweh --&quot;A sun and shield&quot; who doesn&#x27;t withhold any good thing from his people (verses 10-11)</blockquote>
        <p>The psalmist sums it all up with a word of praise directly to Yahweh himself, the Lord of the armies of heaven.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;O LORD of hosts,blessed44is the one who trusts in you!&quot; (Psalm 84:12)</blockquote>
        <p>We are blessed indeed, for the God of heaven has come to earth in the Person of Jesus Christ, to redeem us from sin, to seat us in heavenly places alongside his throne, and to grant to us eternal life in his Kingdom, in that Glorious City of God described in Revelation 22. Indeed, weareblessed!</p>
        <p>Father, turn our eyes to You, the only One who offers the true blessings. Let us find our delight in You. Let us dwell with You, as did the sparrows and swallows in the temple of old. Let us serve You humbly and bask in Your presence. For in You is our Life. All we need is You. We love You. In Jesus&#x27; name, we pray. Amen.</p>

Holladay gives five meanings: (1) come to an end; (2) become finished, complete, (3) disappear, perish, (4) be destroyed, ruined; (5) be determined, resolved; (6) become weak, languish; and (7) be consumed, waste away&quot; (Holladay, p. 158).</p>
          <p class="endnote">[9]&quot;Sing for joy&quot; (ESV, NRSV, NASB), &quot;cry out&quot; (NIV, KJV) is the Piel ofrānan, &quot;cry out, shout for joy.&quot;Rānanappears in parallel poetry with nearly every term for &quot;joy,&quot; &quot;rejoicing&quot; and &quot;praise.&quot; The jubilation which is the main thrust of the root is elsewhere also in a context of music (William White, TWOT #2179).</p>
          <p class="endnote">[10]&quot;Courts&quot; is the plural ofḥāṣēr, &quot;court, enclosure.&quot; Solomon&#x27;s building complex at Jerusalem included: the &quot;inner&quot; court of the temple (1 Kings 6:36; 7:12); the court of the palace (1 Kings 7:8), perhaps the &quot;middle&quot; court of 2 Kings 20:4 (following theQere); and the &quot;great&quot; court covering the entire area of the complex (1 Kings 7:9,12; Edwin Yamauchi, TWOT #922a).</p>
          <p class="endnote">[11]I believe this psalm was writtenpriorto the Exile, because of the prayer for the king in verse 9. There is lots of speculation about the date, however, surveyed in Tate,Psalms(Word), pp. 351-352.</p>
          <p class="endnote">[12]Herod&#x27;s Temple where Jesus worshipped had even more courts: the Priests Court surrounding the temple building, the Court of the Israelites where the men would gather, the Court of the Women, and the Court of the Gentiles.</p>
          <p class="endnote">[13]&quot;Home&quot; (ESV, NIV, NRSV), &quot;house&quot; (KJV) in both verses 3 and 4 isbayit, &quot;house, household, home, place, temple, inward, family, et al.&quot; (TWOT #241). Also verse 10.</p>
          <p class="endnote">[14]&quot;Altars&quot; is the plural ofmizbēaḥ, &quot;altar, place of sacrifice&quot; (TWOT #525b).</p>
          <p class="endnote">[15]&quot;Sparrow&quot; isṣippôr, &quot;bird.&quot; This word for bird is related to the &quot;chirping&quot; sound that a bird makes (John E. Hartley, TWOT #1959a). &quot;Swallow&quot; isderôr, &quot;swallow&quot; (TWOT #454c). &quot;Kind of bird,&quot; traditionally a swallow or dove (Holladay, p. 73). Used only here and in Proverbs 26:2: &quot;Like a sparrow (ṣippôr) in its flitting, like a swallow (derôr) in its flying, a curse that is causeless does not alight.&quot; &quot;Nest&quot; isqēn, &quot;nest&quot; (TWOT 2042a).</p>
          <p class="endnote">[16]&quot;Dwell&quot; is the Qal stem ofyāshab, &quot;sit, remain, dwell&quot; (TWOT #922).</p>
          <p class="endnote">[17]&quot;Selah&quot; perhaps indicates an interlude of some kind, though we&#x27;re not sure (Tremper Longman III,Psalms: An Introduction and Commentary(Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries; InterVarsity Press, 2014), p. 31).</p>
          <p class="endnote">[18]&quot;Blessed&quot; (ʾashērî) is used 3 times: vs. 4, vs. 5, and vs. 12. The Hebrew for &quot;blessed&quot; could be rendered, &quot;fortunate, blessed&quot; or &quot;O the happiness of&quot; the person who fears the Lord. The interjection &quot;fortunate, blessed is (he who)&quot; (Holladay, p. 31). The verbʾāsharin the Piel stem means &quot;to bless,&quot; a synonym ofbārakwith some differences.Bārakis the word usually used when God blesses, whereasʾāsharis reserved for man and a word of envious desire, &quot;to be envied with desire is the man who trusts in the Lord.&quot; God never pronounces a man &quot;blessed&quot; (ʾashrê). Withbārak, the initiative comes from God; man doesn&#x27;t have to deserve it. To be blessed (ʾashrê), man has to do something. Finally,bārakis a benediction,ʾāsharmore of a congratulation (Victor P. Hamilton,ʾāshar, TWOT #183a).</p>
          <p class="endnote">[19]The Piel stem ofhālal, &quot;praise.&quot; This root connotes being sincerely and deeply thankful for and/or satisfied in lauding a superior quality(ies) or great, great act(s) of the object (Leonard J. Copps, TWOT #500; Holladay, p. 80).</p>
          <p class="endnote">[20]&quot;Strength&quot; is the nounʿōz, &quot;strength&quot; fromʿāzaz, &quot;be strong&quot; (TWOT #1596b). There is a different word for strength in verse 7a,ḥayil, but I don&#x27;t see much difference in overall meaning intended, just variety. Notice, the emphasis on the heart, the inner person, excited about this journey.</p>
          <p class="endnote">[21]&quot;Highways to Zion&quot; (ESV, NRSV, NASB), &quot;pilgrimage&quot; (NIV, NJB), &quot;ways&quot; (KJV) is just a single noun:mesillâ, &quot;highway.&quot; The primary meaning of the rootsālalseems to be &quot;cast up, lift up, exalt.&quot; Patterson speculates, &quot;It is probably a denominative from Akkadiansulū&quot;highway, raised way&quot; (fromsalū&quot;to throw up/off/out&quot;). The theme of casting up a highway is utilized by the prophets. The figure, derived from building a road higher than the adjacent terrain, is natural (R.D. Patterson, TWOT #1506d).</p>
          <p class="endnote">[22]Though &quot;Zion&quot; is clearly the destination, the word doesn&#x27;t appear in the Hebrew text here but in verse 7.</p>

          <p class="endnote">[25]&quot;Springs&quot; (ESV, NIV, NRSV), &quot;well&quot; (KJV) ismaʿyān, &quot;spring,&quot; a flow of water from an opening in a hillside or valley (Carl Schultz, TWOT #1613a).</p>

          <p class="endnote">[27]Franz Delitsch writes: &quot;The most gloomy present becomes bright to them: passing through even a terrible wilderness, they turn it into a place of springs, their joyous hope and the infinite beauty of the goal, which is worth any amount of toil and trouble, afford them enlivening comfort, refreshing strengthening in the midst of the arid steppe&quot; (Carl Friedreich Keil,. and Franz Delitzsch,Commentary on the Old Testament(German 1861; T &amp; T Clark, 1891; Kindle version), in loc.</p>
          <p class="endnote">[28]&quot;Strength&quot; (twice in verse 7) isḥayil, &quot;might.&quot; The basic meaning of the rootḥûlis &quot;to be firm, strong.&quot;Ḥayilcan be variously translated from the basic idea of &quot;strength,&quot; from which follow &quot;army&quot; and &quot;wealth&quot; -- &quot;might, strength, power; able, valiant, virtuous, valor; army, host, forces; riches, substance, wealth; et al.&quot; (Carl Philip Weber, TWOT #624a). This is a different word for strength thanʿōzin verse 5, but probably just for variety.</p>

Culver, TWOT #2095). &quot;Look on&quot; (ESV, NRSV, KJV), &quot;look with favor on&quot; (NIV) is the Hiphil stem ofnābaṭ, &quot;look, regard.&quot; The root represents that which one does with the eye, embracing everything from a mere glance, to a careful, sustained, and favorable contemplation. It is frequently paralleled torāʾâ(Leonard J. Coppes, TWOT #1282).</p>
