        <p>One of the most winsome invitations in the Bible is offered by Jesus:</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;28Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.29Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.30For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.&quot; (Matthew 11:28-30, ESV)</blockquote>
        <p>I invite you to mine its treasures with me as we seek to find what it tells us about Jesus, about us, and about the Christian life.</p>
        <p>Just previous to this, Jesus has denounced the stubborn unbelief in the Galilean towns where he has performed his greatest miracles (Matthew 11:20-24). Then he marvels at how his Father has revealed an intimate knowledge not to the wise and learned, but to &quot;little children,&quot; a term of endearment for his true disciples who come with openness, humility, and obedience to learn from him (Matthew 11:25-27).</p>

        <p>Now we arrive at the invitation</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Come to me, all who laborand are heavy laden,and I will give you rest.&quot; (Matthew 11:28)</blockquote>
        <p>Jesus calls1to the people who crowd around him for hope, for healing, for answers. They had gone to the Pharisees, considered the strictest, the most intense seekers after God. But all they ended up with was instruction in how to obey more rules more precisely. Jesus&#x27; criticism of their religious practice is unsparing.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;You travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.&quot; (Matthew 23:15)</blockquote>
        <p>They deal in legalism, not life.</p>
        <p>To religion-weary people, Jesus&#x27; invitation is refreshing.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Come to me, all wholaborand areheavy laden,and I will give you rest.&quot; (Matthew 11:28)</blockquote>
        <p>The verbs describe his hearers. The first, &quot;labor&quot;, means more than &quot;to work.&quot; It expresses the exhaustion that comes from labor: &quot;to become weary, tired,&quot; to &quot;strive, struggle.&quot;2The second verb, &quot;heavy laden&quot; has the idea of overloading a donkey -- or a person -- to the maximum weight that they can carry.3It recalls Jesus&#x27; criticism of the legalism imposed by the scribes and the Pharisees:</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people&#x27;s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger.&quot; (Matthew 23:4)</blockquote>
        <p>Sometimes the Jews referred to this heavy burden as taking on the &quot;yoke of the law.&quot;</p>
        <p>To carry heavy loads more efficiently, humans invented yokes -- wooden devices that enable men or beasts to carry weight across their shoulders.4Yokes join a pair of oxen so they can pull a load together. But here, I think Jesus has in mind a human yoke that helps distribute the weight over the shoulders.</p>
        <p>Originally, yokes were mere wood poles with ropes hanging down at both ends to carry buckets or bundles of firewood. Backpack frames are now made of aluminum, but once they were made of wood to transfer weight to the shoulders.</p>
        <p>In Bible times, yokes were associated with oppression and slavery because they typified the heavy labor of slaves.5Sometimes the yoke expressed a bondage to sin (Lamentations 1:14). As mentioned above, the expression, the &quot;yoke of the law&quot; was common among rabbis to describe taking upon oneself an obligation to obey the law. But the Pharisees&#x27; expression of law-keeping was oppressive (Acts 15:10; Galatians 5:1).</p>
        <p>Legalism can seem attractive at first because it clearly defines what is expected. There&#x27;s no middle ground. You either achieve the standard or you don&#x27;t. And so we strive for perfection, we crank up our self-discipline. For a while we&#x27;re okay, but then we fail and feel awful. And we either end up depressed or self-deceived, in deep despair or proud that somehow we can attain perfection and salvation by our own efforts -- and thus are superior to others. Legalism is exhausting and ends up warping one&#x27;s self-image. Consistent perfection is unachievable, though under a legalistic system, nothing less will do.</p>
        <p>To this image of heavy, joy-less, legalistic religion. Jesus offers his alternative.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Come to me, all who laborand are heavy laden,andI will give you rest.&quot; (Matthew 11:28)</blockquote>
        <p>Jesus offers relief from toil, rest, a refreshing, a reviving of spirits.6He offers an alternative yoke to the yoke of the Pharisees.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Take my yoke upon you,and learn from me,for I am gentle and lowly in heart,and you will find rest for your souls.&quot; (Matthew 11:29)</blockquote>
        <p>Here&#x27;s that word &quot;rest&quot; again, &quot;cessation from wearisome activity.&quot;7</p>
        <p>The disciples had been absorbing the exhausting values of the Pharisees -- or perhaps the corrupting values of the world. Now Jesus calls them to &quot;learnfrom me.&quot;8The Greek noun &quot;disciple&quot; is formed from the same root. Disciples are those eager to learn from Jesus.</p>
        <p>Jesus gives three reasons we should come to him.</p>
        <p>1. Jesus is &quot;gentle&quot;(KJV &quot;meek&quot;). The word suggests humility, consideration of others, not being impressed with one&#x27;s own importance.9Jesus is gentle compared to the harsh and demanding nature of the law&#x27;s teachers. He knows that we are weak. He loves us. He has died to take our sins upon him. He doesn&#x27;t have to make us into something to love us; he loves us as we are. He doesn&#x27;t operate from demand, but from love.</p>
        <p>2. Jesus is lowly in heart. This is a similar word: unpretentious, humble.10So many leaders, so many teachers, so many pastors have hearts that have become puffed up with knowledge, with position, with business, with a self-importance regularly re-inflated by the adulation of people. And they approach people from an elevation that can be felt in their attitude.</p>
        <p>But not Jesus. Though he is God, he has emptied himself, humbled himself to be one of us (Philippians 2:5-8). He calls us out of a good and sincere heart because he genuinely cares for our welfare and wants to comfort us.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.&quot; (Matthew 9:36)</blockquote>
        <p>3. Jesus can provide rest for our souls.Too often you are unable to quiet your soul, your inner self.11You can&#x27;t calm your struggling heart, but he can. He calls you to him because he can actually do in you what you cannot do for yourself. You&#x27;ve been trying to follow God your way. Just stop. Come to him. And let him show you how it&#x27;s done.</p>
        <p>If the &quot;yoke of the law&quot; was burdensome, Jesus&#x27; way of life is different.</p>
        <blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;For my yoke is easy,and my burden is light.&quot; (Matthew 11:30)</blockquote>
        <p>He does have a yoke, a device to help carry the burdens of life along his path. But his yoke has two characteristics:</p>
        <p>Legalism abounds in certain branches of Christianity bearing the fruit of hypocrisy, fear, and despair. In others branches of the faith there is little talk of sin or of living a holy life, of seeking to be pleasing to God. This yields the fruit of lives that look little different from those of non-Christians.</p>
        <p>We seek to live in a different place. Our emphases ought to be:</p>
        <p>The antidote for legalism is love for Jesus.</p>
