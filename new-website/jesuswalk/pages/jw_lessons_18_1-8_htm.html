<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;1Then Jesus told his disciples a  parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.2He said: &#x27;In a certain town there was a  judge who neither feared God nor cared about men.3And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the  plea, &quot;Grant me justice against my adversary.&quot;4For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, &quot;Even  though I don&#x27;t fear God or care about men,5yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets  justice, so that she won&#x27;t eventually wear me out with her coming!&quot;&#x27;6And the Lord said, &#x27;Listen to what the  unjust judge says.7And will not God  bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will  he keep putting them off?8I tell you,  he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man  comes, will he find faith on the earth?&#x27;&quot; (Luke 18:1-8, KJV)</blockquote>

<p>For now we&#x27;ve left Jesus&#x27; teaching on the Coming of the Son  of Man (except for 18:8b), and are beginning a new block of teaching on faith  and the quality of those disciples who please God.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show  them that they should always pray and not give up.&quot; (18:1)</blockquote>
<p>Verse 1 starts with &quot;Then.&quot; Notice that this teaching on  prayer follows directly on Jesus&#x27; teaching on the coming of the Son of Man.  Indeed, verse 8 ends with that theme. So we should think of verse 1 as an  exhortation to disciples who may be undergoing a struggle just prior to the  coming of the Son of Man not to give up hope, but to pray, expecting a speedy  answer.</p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/5f648c15_millais-unjust-judge-214x275.jpg" alt="John Everett Millais, &#x27;The Unjust Judge and the Importunate Widow&#x27; (1864)" loading="lazy"><figcaption>John Everett Millais, &#x27;The Unjust Judge and the Importunate Widow&#x27; (1864)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Characteristically, Jesus instructs his disciples with a  parable, a story to make a spiritual point. Luke reveals the point of the  parable in advance: &quot;that they should always pray and not give up&quot; (18:1b). The  word translated &quot;always&quot; is Greekpantote, &quot;always, at all times.&quot;733The word &quot;prayer&quot; is the common Greek wordproscheuomai, &quot;to petition  deity, pray.&quot;734Jesus is teaching continual prayer, again and again, rather than continuous,  non-stop prayer. To &quot;pray without ceasing&quot; (1 Thessalonians 1:3; 2:13; 5:17; 2  Timothy 1:3) is to pray repeatedly, time and again.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve heard Bible teachers say that once you&#x27;ve asked God for  something that it displays lack of faith to ask for it again, since you ought to  believe you already have received it (Mark 11:24). But Jesus teaches clearly  that we are to continue to pray until we receive the answer. That continued  prayer is not a sign of little faith, but of persistent faith.</p>
<p>The danger is that we get discouraged and quit praying. The  word translated &quot;give up&quot; (NIV) or &quot;faint&quot; (KJV) in 18:1 is Greekenkakeō,  &quot;to lose one&#x27;s motivation in continuing a desirable pattern of conduct or  activity, lose enthusiasm, be discouraged,&quot;735fromen, &quot;into, entering into&quot; +kakos, &quot;base, wrong, wicked.&quot;</p>
<p>Now Jesus introduces the characters in his story.</p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/b46ec938_luke-cover-114x140.gif" alt="Discipleship Training in Luke&#x27;s Gospel, by Dr. Ralph F. Wilson" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Discipleship Training in Luke&#x27;s Gospel, by Dr. Ralph F. Wilson</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;He said: &#x27;In a certain town there was a judge who  neither feared God nor cared about men.&#x27;&quot; (18:2)</blockquote>
<p>The phrase &quot;feared God&quot; refers to piety, faith in God, and  recognition that God will judge the sons of men. The judge had no regard for  God&#x27;s justice. The phrase &quot;cared about&quot; (NIV) or &quot;respected&quot; (KJV) is Greekentrepō, &quot;to show deference to a person in recognition of special status,  &#x27;turn toward something/someone, have regard for, respect,&#x27;&quot; in this context &quot;who  showed deference to no human.&quot;736The judge is not a a man-pleaser. Neither does he respect the special needs of the  poor and oppressed. He is independent or thinks he is. He isn&#x27;t overly  concerned about public opinion.</p>
<p>He was concerned with himself -- his own opinions, his own  comfort, his own income. In verse 6, Jesus calls him &quot;unjust,&quot; Greekadikia,  &quot;wrongdoing, unrighteousness, wickedness, injustice.&quot;737Though it isn&#x27;t explicit, there was probably a reason that the judge wouldn&#x27;t  give the widow justice -- it probably had to do with money. I consider it likely  that the judge was either taking bribes to fatten his purse or had an  &quot;arrangement&quot; with a wealthy citizen who stood to lose if the widow won her  case. The judge was arrogant, self-absorbed, and unjust, a powerful man facing  down one of the weakest members of society -- a widow.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;And there was a widow in that town who kept coming  to him with the plea, &#x27;Grant me justice against my adversary.&#x27;&quot; (18:3)</blockquote>
<p>Widows had a difficult place in Palestine -- around the world,  in fact. Normally, the wife of a deceased husband had no legal right to inherit  her husband&#x27;s estate, so when her husband died, she couldn&#x27;t take for granted  living in his house on his land. If her deceased husband had no children, the  estate reverted to her husband&#x27;s male relatives on his father&#x27;s side -- his  brothers, his father&#x27;s brothers, and then the nearest family kinsman. If she had  grown children things would be easier; they would take care of Mom. But a widow  with small children might just as well have to contend for property rights with  her in-laws, and if they didn&#x27;t happen to like her, things could be difficult.  In some cases, she might manage the estate to be inherited by her young children  as a trustee, but that was by no means a sure thing.738</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t know how the widow was being cheated, but her judge  was on her opponent&#x27;s side. She didn&#x27;t have money for lawyers. She was probably  holding on by a hair. But there is one thing we know about her -- she was  persistent.</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;kept coming&quot; is the common Greek verberchomai,  &quot;come.&quot; Here it is in the imperfect tense, indicating repeated or continued  action in the past. She hadn&#x27;t come just once, but many times. The word  translated &quot;grant me justice&quot; (NIV) or &quot;avenge me&quot; (KJV), here and in verse 5,  is Greekekdikeō, &quot;to procure justice for someone, grant justice.&quot;739</p>
<p>She didn&#x27;t take &quot;no&quot; for an answer. Instead, every time court  was in session, here would be the widow, asking for -- no, demanding -- the  justice to which she was entitled. Everyone in town knew about her case. If she  had kept quiet, things would have died down. But since she kept on demanding  justice, vocally, publicly, time after time, the inevitable questions would  begin. &quot;Maybe sheisbeing cheated.&quot; &quot;Maybe shedoeshave a case.&quot;  The judge&#x27;s credibility may have been called into question. She was a squeaky  wheel demanding oil.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;For some time he refused. But finally he said to  himself, &#x27;Even though I don&#x27;t fear God or care about men, yet because this widow  keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won&#x27;t  eventually wear me out with her coming!&#x27;&quot; (Luke 18:4-5)</blockquote>
<p>The phrase &quot;keeps bothering&quot; translates two Greek words.Parechō, &quot;to cause to happen or be brought about, cause, make happen,&quot;740is in the present tense, which here indicates continued action in the present.  The second word is Greekkopos, &quot;a state of discomfort or distress,  trouble, difficulty,&quot; originally &quot;a beating&quot;. The idea here is &quot;cause trouble  for someone, bother someone.&quot;741</p>
<p>This weak little widow is starting to make the powerful judge  feel some heat. The phrase &quot;wear me out&quot; is Greekhypopiazō, literally,  &quot;give a black eye to, strike in the face.&quot; The judge may have been speaking in  hyperbole or exaggeration -- she wasn&#x27;t threatening him with bodily harm. But a  figurative meaning of the word is &quot;to bring someone to submission by constant  annoyance, wear down, browbeat,&quot; or perhaps &quot;slander, besmirch.&quot;742This widow&#x27;s constant appeals were hurting the judge&#x27;s reputation. Whatever he  had been paid wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle she was causing. He decided to grant her  what she was due just to get rid of her.</p>
<p>This wasn&#x27;t a real widow, of course, nor a real judge, but  Jesus&#x27; hearers had met widows like her, and had experience with judges like him.  All over the audience you could see people nodding their heads. They&#x27;d met  people like that. The story was true-to-life.</p>
<p>Now that Jesus has is audience with him, he brings the  application:</p>
<p>&quot;And the Lord said, &#x27;Listen to what the unjust judge  says. And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to  him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that  they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find  faith on the earth?&#x27;&quot; (18:6-8)</p>
<p>Now, for the unjust judge and the widow, Jesus substitutes God  and his elect (eklektos, &quot;chosen ones&quot;). Wait a minute, you say. God  isn&#x27;t unjust! No, and that&#x27;s just the point. Jesus&#x27; argument is from the lesser  to the greater: If an unjust, selfish judge will see that justice is done in  response to persistent requests, how much more will the just God bring justice  to his own beloved people who pray constantly for relief.</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;bring about justice&quot; (NIV) or &quot;avenge&quot; (KJV) is  the noun form,ekdikēsis(found here and in verse 8), of the verbekdikeōused in verses 3 and 5 above. It means &quot;giving of justice, see to it that  justice is done.&quot;743</p>
<p>I think of a poignant passage in the book of Revelation:</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the  altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the  testimony they had maintained. They called out in a loud voice, &#x27;How long,  Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and  avenge our blood?&#x27; Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told  to wait a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and brothers  who were to be killed as they had been was completed.&quot; (Revelation 6:9-11)</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes we cry, &quot;How long, Lord?&quot; Sometimes it seems that  God will never answer. In the sentence, &quot; Will he keep putting them off? I tell  you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly&quot; (18:7), the phrase &quot;keep  putting them off&quot; (NIV) or &quot;bear long&quot; (KJV) is Greekmakrothumeō,  &quot;delay.&quot; This is the only place in the New Testament where this meaning occurs. Usually it  is translated &quot;have patience&quot; or &quot;be patient.&quot;744</p>
<p>Jesus&#x27; answer is firm: &quot;He will see that they get justice, and  quickly&quot; (18:8). The word &quot;quickly&quot; is Greektachos, &quot;speed, quickness,  swiftness, haste&quot; or, with the prepositionenas an adverbial unit, &quot;soon,  in a short time.&quot;745Our word &quot;tachometer&quot; (measuring speed of rotation) comes from this Greek word.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s easy to get discouraged, disappointed. When I was a  young man I was sure I would see Christ&#x27;s Return in my lifetime. But now I am  several decades older and he still hasn&#x27;t come. How long, Lord? How long until  your will is done on earth as it is in heaven? How can you let evil go on so  long?</p>
<p>If you read carefully Jesus&#x27; words to his disciples, you see  that his message is consistent: Stay spiritually awake and be ready, for I come  in an hour that you do not expect. When we try to put his Second Coming on a  calendar, we get disappointed. We&#x27;re not the only ones. In the latter part of  the first century, Peter wrote:</p>
<p>&quot;First of all, you must understand that in the last  days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. They  will say, &quot;Where is this &#x27;coming&#x27; he promised? Ever since our fathers died,  everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation....</p>
<p>But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With  the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.  The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is  patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to  repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will  disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and  everything in it will be laid bare.&quot; (2 Peter 3:3-4, 8-10)</p>
<p>When Jesus comes it will be at the right time. Not our time  or our preference, but God&#x27;s -- the right time.</p>
<p>During the American Civil War on May 5, 1864, General A.P. Hill&#x27;s  Confederate forces have been mauled by General Hancock&#x27;s Union troops in The Wilderness  Campaign, but dark has fallen. Hold out until morning, General Lee tells Hill; General  Longstreet will be here to relieve you. But dawn has broken and Longstreet is  late. Hill&#x27;s thin lines break in panic as the Union forces push forward once  again. Where is Longstreet? Where is he?</p>
<p>Finally, Longstreet arrives. He is late according to Lee&#x27;s  plan, but just at the right time to flank Hancock&#x27;s Union troops and turn the tide. Had he  gotten there too early, his troops may have panicked along with Hill&#x27;s. But  Longstreet arrives just in time to turn the battle, and Lee&#x27;s army survives to  fight another day.</p>
<p>When Jesus comes, he will come at just the right time. His  coming is sure, but Jesus wonders aloud at the faithfulness of his troops.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find  faith on the earth?&quot; (18:8b)</blockquote>
<p>Jesus has told a parable of persistence, of a widow -- weak in  the world&#x27;s estimation -- who has won a victory because she didn&#x27;t give up hope,  she doesn&#x27;t give up her plea, and finally wins the day. But what about you and  me? We sometimes become so worn down and discouraged by our lives that we stop  praying, stop hoping, stop expecting God to intervene. Will we be religious,  church-going unbelievers, who have given up expecting an answer, whose prayers  are just going through the motions? Jesus wonders. &quot;When the Son of Man comes,  will he find faith on the earth?&quot; (18:8b)</p>
<p>My dear friend, Jesus told this story to us disciples so that  we might be encouraged. None of you is weaker than the widow. None of you is  facing longer odds than she. But because of her persistence and faith, even the  unjust judge gave her what was hers by right.</p>
<p>How much more you can expect God to intervene on your behalf!  How much more will God bring justice to you, since you are his beloved, chosen  child! Yes, we become discouraged. Paul did (2 Corinthians 1:8; 4:8-12). But we  must not quit, not give up praying.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast,  immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord  your labor is not in vain.&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:58, RSV)</p>
<p>Lord, I know what it&#x27;s like to come to a place of  discouragement so deep that it&#x27;s hard to pray any longer, hard to hold out hope.  Some of my brothers and sisters are there right now and you are speaking to  their hearts. Lift them, today, I pray. Turn their eyes to you afresh.  Strengthen their faith, freshen their hope, enliven their prayers -- until you  come. Come soon, Lord Jesus! Amen.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;And will not God bring about justice for his chosen  ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell  you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of  Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?&quot; (Luke 18:7-8)</blockquote>
