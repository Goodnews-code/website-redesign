    <div class="article-body"><p>Let me share with you a heavy burden on my heart and then some Scripture that speaks directly to the need. Please excuse the long introduction here, but I need to share it so you understand the urgency of the text we&#x27;ll be studying. Covid-19 is related, but it&#x27;s not really the point, as you&#x27;ll see.</p>
<p>This is my burden. As I look across our land, I see a vast wounded army of Christians, believers who no longer attend worship regularly. Or attend at all.</p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/8523ff2e_hebrews-top-2025-468x100.gif" alt="Disciple Lessons from Hebrews -- JesusWalk Bible Study Series" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Disciple Lessons from Hebrews -- JesusWalk Bible Study Series</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of the wounded are shut-ins, physically unable to get out to church anymore. The accumulated ailments of age prevent them. Their caregivers can&#x27;t get out either. Understandable. God knows.</p>
<p>But many of these wounded believers never darken the doors of church because of sin or pain or selfishness or laziness. They can be described, if truth be told, with one sad Bible word: &quot;backslidden,&quot;1often translated &quot;unfaithful&quot; or &quot;faithless.&quot;</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Our backsliding is great; we have sinned against you.&quot; (Jeremiah 14:7, NIV)</blockquote>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/b47b4f32_albrecht-anker-wounded-soldier-222x275.jpg" alt="Albrecht Anker, &#x27;Wounded Soldier&#x27; (1870s)" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Albrecht Anker, &#x27;Wounded Soldier&#x27; (1870s)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, I&#x27;m sure that these wounded believers would reject that labelvigorously. I&#x27;mnotbackslidden! I take your e-mail Bible studies, Pastor. That makes up for what I would get in church! I just can&#x27;t find a good church in my area -- at least not one of my denomination, one that meets my standards of what a good church should be.</p>
<p>I remember when they sang the old hymns and wore suits and dresses to honor God. Not any more! These younger folks just don&#x27;t appreciate us older Christians. You wouldn&#x27;t want me to compromise my standards of what church should be, would you? Of course not!</p>
<p>To tell the truth, Pastor, I&#x27;ve been hurt. We used to have a pastor whose moral failing injured me, made me cynical. And I have suffered wounds from insensitive, hypocritical hateful people in the house of God. I just can&#x27;t bring myself to go and be hurt again. So I stay home.</p>
<p>Pastor, during the Covid pandemic I got used to going to church on TV or YouTube. And I&#x27;ve kept on after Covid. Faithfully! The preachers on TV are great -- far better than any pastor in my town, I can tell you that! And the music is wonderful, professionally done. Sometimes I hum along. It&#x27;s pleasing to me. I&#x27;m getting fed and blessed. What&#x27;s not to like about that?</p>
<p>I am quiet as I ponder these responses and wonder how Jesus would evaluate them.</p>
<p>But as I look more closely at this wounded army, I see vast numbers who no longer actuallyworship, at least, not in Bible ways. They no longergather to honor the Lordthey say they love. They no longer join with God&#x27;s people in their community as a united witness of allegiance to their Savior. They no longer celebrate new life with baptism in the midst of the Christian family. They no longer partake of the Lord&#x27;s Supper with other believers. I see them as &quot;Lone Ranger2Christians.&quot;</p>
<p>As I look over the land, I see towns and cities who now have more self-identified Christians who stay home, than those who faithfully gather in the house of God each week. This vast hidden army is largely made up of AWOL soldiers -- Absent With Out Leave.</p>
<p>Many of these wounded soldiers are now financially stunted, since they have stopped giving financially to Kingdom work and have thus deprived themselves of the financial promises God intended for his people.</p>
<p>The flow of their spiritual gifts, too, designed to be used to bless God&#x27;s people, has ceased. These God-given ministries are no longer well-oiled by the Spirit, but rusty from disuse. The love and encouragement and instruction they once offered hurting Christian brothers and sisters, boys and girls, has gone still -- unsaid, ungiven, unblessed. It is a sad picture. And this picture likely includes you or someone you love.</p>
<p>As I look across the land, I see struggling congregations, the ones that are left after Covid took its toll. I see overworked pastors and their families struggling to stay afloat. I feel the desperate needs for Sunday school teachers and workers. Harvest fields in the neighborhoods are now neglected. Lost people no longer hear the word, because, as Jesus said, &quot;The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.&quot; Foreign missionaries are being forced to return home due to lack of funds. There is big-time discouragement among the faithful.</p>
<p>But it shouldn&#x27;t be this way. It doesn&#x27;t have to be!</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:22-26 gives us five exhortations to ponder. The Letter to the Hebrews was written to Jewish Christians who were tempted to return to their old ways and forsake following Jesus as Messiah. It was a spiritual battle for their very souls!</p>
<p>Each of the five exhortations in these verses begin with the words in our English Bibles, &quot;Let us.&quot;3</p>
<p>The first of these exhortations is found in verse 22</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.&quot; (Hebrews 10:22)</blockquote>
<p>To &quot;draw near&quot; (NIV, KJV) or &quot;approach&quot; God4is not a trivial action. Consider how hard it would be to gain an audience with the CEO of a major corporation or a nation&#x27;s president or king (Esther 4:11). We are called, invited, to come before the very presence of God himself!</p>
<p>Our approach should be accompanied with several qualities.</p>
<p>The second exhortation is a call to perseverance:</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.&quot; (Hebrews 10:23)</blockquote>
<p>The readers were tempted to fall back to their old  Judaism. Here, they are told to &quot;hold on&quot; (Hebrews 3:6) and &quot;hold firmly&quot; (Hebrews 3:14; 4:147) to Christ and his  teachings. The verb iskatechō, &quot;to adhere  firmly to traditions, convictions, or beliefs, hold to, hold fast.&quot;8</p>
<p>Notice thehow, themannerwith which they are to hold on: unswervingly, without wavering. The word means literally &quot;not to lean,&quot; that is, &quot;bending to neither side ... without wavering.&quot;9</p>
<p>Andwhatare they to hold on to? &quot;The hope we profess,&quot; that is, the firm expectation that Christ &quot;will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him&quot; (Hebrews 9:28).</p>
<p>Whyshould we believe this? Because &quot;he who promised is faithful&quot; (pistos), that is &quot;pertaining to being worthy of belief or  trust, trustworthy, faithful, dependable, inspiring trust/faith.&quot;10We can trust God because he is faithful, so let us hold on to him persistently!</p>
<p>The third exhortation is a call to Christian fellowship. The first two exhortations relate to our own relationship to God. The third commands attention to spiritual health ofothersin the congregation.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.&quot; (Hebrews 10:24)</blockquote>
<p>So often we consider ourselves first and foremost, but that is selfish. Verse 24 tells us to consider the needs of others!11This takes two forms:</p>
<p>Means. &quot;Stir up&quot; (ESV), &quot;spur on&quot; (NIV) or &quot;provoke&quot; (KJV, NRSV) translates a Greek noun that means &quot;rousing to activity, stirring  up, provoking.&quot;12The verb means basically &quot;to cause a state of inward arousal, urge on, stimulate.&quot;13</p>
<p>Goal.The purpose is encourage or prod others toward &quot;love and good deeds.&quot; Christianity is not designed as a hermit-oriented faith (though a few Church Fathers were hermits), but one with intense love and concern for one another in the congregation. Jesus said, &quot;By this everyone will  know that you are my disciples, if you love one another&quot; (John 13:35).  If we take seriously Jesus&#x27; primary command to &quot;love your neighbor as yourself&quot; (Luke 10:27), we can&#x27;t isolate ourselves. We are commanded to &quot;do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers&quot; (Galatians 6:10).</p>
<p>It is hard to spur one another along remotely. This is a face-to-face ministry!</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing.&quot; (Hebrews 10:25a)</blockquote>
<p>A fourth exhortation is a negative command. Don&#x27;t &quot;give up&quot; (NIV), &quot;neglecting&quot; (ESV, NRSV), &quot;forsaking&quot; (KJV) meeting together. The wordengkataleipōis a strong one. It means,&quot;to separate connection with someone or something,  forsake, abandon, desert.&quot;14It is the Greek word used in Jesus&#x27; prayer based on Psalm 22:2, &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&quot; (Matthew 27:46). It is the word used in the firm promise, &quot;I will never leave you or forsake you&quot; (Hebrews 13:5b based on Deuteronomy 31:6).</p>
<p>Notice that abandoning, deserting your brothers and sisters in church gathering is a bad &quot;habit.&quot;15</p>
<p>So often, people attend or don&#x27;t attend church based on whether they perceive it meets their own needs. That is grossly selfish and contrary to the direct command of scripture! Rather, we should attend congregational meetings also (1) to worship God and (2) to encourage our Christian brothers and sisters. When we abandon regular Christian fellowship, we hurt ourselves. We deprive God of the honor due him! We deprive our brothers and sisters of encouragement. And we deprive other believers of the gifts and ministries God has given to us on their behalf in a sacred trust!Don&#x27;t abandon your brothers and sisters!It is a bad habit! So says God&#x27;s Word!</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;But let us encourage one another -- and all the more as you see the Day approaching.&quot; (Hebrews 10:25b)</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of an earlier exhortation in the Letter to the Hebrews:</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin&#x27;s deceitfulness.&quot; (Hebrews 3:13)</blockquote>
<p>These verses have two similarities: (1) an exhortation to encouragement, and (2) a concern for the times we live in -- the Last Days.</p>
<p>Christian encouragement is needed to help us -- and our brothers and sisters -- to stay on the path of Jesus. To keep us from being hardened, made cynical, become increasingly dull and calloused. The word &quot;hardened&quot; in Hebrews 3:13 issklēruno, &quot;to cause to be unyielding in resisting  information, harden.&quot;16It is used in the phrases &quot;hardened hearts&quot; and &quot;stiff necks.&quot; We need to help one another!</p>
<p>The verbparakaleō, found in both verses, means &quot;to urge thoroughly, appeal to, urge, exhort, encourage,&quot; literally &quot;to call to one&#x27;s side.&quot;17The Holy Spirit is called our Paraclete or &quot;Comforter, Counselor, Helper&quot; (John  14-16) because he is the One God calls alongside us to encourage us and help us.  When we renege on our encouragement to one another by being absent from church or a small group meeting of believers, it is a serious thing.</p>
<p>Both Hebrews 10:25 and 3:13 mention the times in which we live.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;... as you see the Day (of Judgment and Christ&#x27;s coming) approaching&quot; (Hebrews 10:25)</blockquote>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;... as long as it is called Today&quot; (Hebrews 3:13)</blockquote>
<p>Judgment day is coming when we will face Jesus and give  answer for our lives (2 Corinthians 5:10; Romans 14:10). Then it will be too  late to repent and do on earth what Christ has told us to do. Too late.</p>
<p>The writer of Hebrews calls us to revival.</p>
<p>I find myself praying daily for a Holy Spirit revival to have mercy on us, to sweep across our land and turn us back to God!</p>
<p>My dear friend, pray with me for revival. First, revival in me. &quot;Not the preacher or the teacher, but it&#x27;s me, O Lord, standing in the need of prayer.&quot; Then, revival in our churches -- the church that God directs you by his Word to support and be part of. And revival in our nation, our region, our continent. O God, send us revival or we die!</p>
