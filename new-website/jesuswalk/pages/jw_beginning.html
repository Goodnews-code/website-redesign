    <div class="article-body"><p>Many people come to Christ, but don&#x27;t get the early  teaching and mentoring they need to grow well as Christians. The number of new  believers at any one time in most churches is too small to warrant a class -- and  there&#x27;s often no other model readily available.</p>
<p>JesusWalk - Beginning the Journeyis a discipleship training and spiritual  formation program for new believers. The course provides a balance of  Christian doctrines, core values, and spiritual disciplines designed to  produce strong Christians who continue to grow as committed disciples of  Jesus.</p>

<p>The 12-part series is coordinated withfree online lessons and videosavailable below or  can be used with anoptional bookand optional DVD set.</p>
<p>Each lesson concludes with a memory verse, questions and discussion points,  and an outline of the lesson. These provide the structure for a weekly meeting  between amentor and the new Christianor for use in aclassorsmall group.</p>
<p>A healthy Christian results from a careful balance. Thus this series doesn&#x27;t  stress only basic Christian beliefs. Rather we seek to train new believers in a  balance of:</p>

<p>Churches will find this study especially useful. Pastors can assign older  believers as mentors and either put theprinted bookin  their hands or point them to the Internet to view theonline  video lessons freeof charge and print out thefree  participant guide.Pastor, here&#x27;s an introduction designed to  explain the series to you.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what a typical hour and a quarter session with a mentor might look  like:</p>
<p>This carefully designed spiritual formation curriculum for  new believers intended to be studied with a mentor -- not alone.</p>
<p>The word &quot;mentor&quot; probably implies more than I intend. I  don&#x27;t mean a highly trained, sophisticated, completely mature person. They&#x27;re  often considerably older than many new believers and too far removed in time  from their lives &quot;before Christ&quot; to remember what it was like.</p>

<p>Rather, I see this mentor as a Christian friend who is growing well in Christ  and a bit farther along the path than the new believer.  He or she could be the person who led the new convert to Christ, a person the  new believer latches onto, or someone assigned by a pastor to work with a new  believer. A lesson is available toprepare and  train a mentorfor this assignment.</p>
<p>The lessons and discussion questions provide the structure  for learning. Being a mentor won&#x27;t take special knowledge beyond what a growing  Christian already has learned. However, the mentor will want to check in with a  pastor or lay leader from time to time as questions arise.</p>
<p>The point is that the new believer learns in community,  alongside a friend who can be a coach in basic Christian living, as well as a  personal bridge to other Christian friends and to a local congregation. The  Christian faith is caught, as well as taught.JesusWalk: Beginning the Journeyis designed  to be walked together, two-by-two, never alone.</p>
<p>Many churches have usedGrowing in Christ(NavPress) to disciple new  Christians. It&#x27;s great material; I&#x27;ve used it many times with new believers. But  it is workbook-based.JesusWalk - Beginning the Journeyuses video based  lessons that provide more thorough explanations, with questions for discussion  with a mentor.  And it can be used free! It doesn&#x27;t require the believer to look up answers in a  Bible and fill in the blanks -- helpful, but daunting for people without strong  language skills, thus lowering the likelihood of  completion. Ultimately, both are great tools to grow a healthy  crop of new believers.</p>
<p>&quot;We have used the JesusWalk series extensively in training new converts in  the basics of the faith. The series is absolutely spot-on doctrinally, being  Bible based. The series is very easy to follow, without being patronising. Just  clear, concise and easy to understand. Highly recommended for the new believer  to become grounded in the faith.&quot; -- Paul Toschi, Greenlane Presbyterian Church,  New Zealand (Amazon reviewer)</p>
<p>&quot;Great book for a new members&#x27; class. If you desire to get your new members  off to a good start in the Christian faith, then this is the perfect book for  young people and adults.&quot; -- Hoyle Edwards (Amazon reviewer)</p>
<p>&quot;Although I&#x27;ve been a Christian all my life, after reading this book I  realized I had a lot to learn.... Kept me interested to the very end and it was  very easy to understand. If you&#x27;re new to Christianity or just want to start at  the basics, this book is definitely ... for you.&quot; -- Amazon customer</p>
<p>&quot;Thoughtful and spiritual,Beginning the Journeyis a powerful read  for Christians, very highly recommended..&quot; -- Midwest Book Review (Amazon  reviewer)</p>
<p>&quot;Easy to read, perfect for someone new to the faith, and an excellent tool  for churches, small groups, or leaders wanting to build a solid foundation for  Christ followers..&quot; -- Veritas (Amazon reviewer)</p>
<p>The vast majority of users will access the lessons and  videos free of charge on the Internet. However,printed booksand DVDs  are available to churches  that need them.Pastors and church leaders can  learn moreabout how to use this series in their ministries.</p>
