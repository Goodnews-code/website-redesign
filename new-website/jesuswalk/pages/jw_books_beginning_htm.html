<p>&quot;I am currently deployed. I am using yourJesusWalk: Beginning the Journeymaterials for a New Believers Class  I am leading at our base chapel. Last night I felt the Spirit leading me  to write you a quick &#x27;thank you&#x27; for producing such a  well-conceived/designed course. As proctor for the class, I can assure  you that your course has been a true blessing to this ministry. Thank  you for your service and commitment to Christ!&quot; -- Lt. Colonel, Gulf  region&quot;We have used the JesusWalk series extensively in training new  converts in the basics of the faith. The series is absolutely spot-on  doctrinally, being Bible based. The series is very easy to follow,  without being patronising. Just clear, concise and easy to understand.  Highly recommended for the new believer to become grounded in the  faith.&quot; -- Paul Toschi, Greenlane Presbyterian Church, New Zealand  (Amazon reviewer)&quot;Great book for a new members&#x27; class. If you desire to get your new  members off to a good start in the Christian faith, then this is the  perfect book for young people and adults.&quot; -- Hoyle Edwards (Amazon  reviewer)&quot;Although I&#x27;ve been a Christian all my life, after reading this book  I realized I had a lot to learn.... Kept me interested to the very end  and it was very easy to understand. If you&#x27;re new to Christianity or  just want to start at the basics, this book is definitely ... for you.&quot;  -- Amazon customer&quot;Thoughtful and spiritual,Beginning the Journeyis a powerful  read for Christians, very highly recommended..&quot; -- Midwest Book Review  (Amazon reviewer)&quot;Easy to read, perfect for someone new to the faith, and an excellent  tool for churches, small groups, or leaders wanting to build a solid  foundation for Christ followers..&quot; -- Veritas (Amazon reviewer)</p>
