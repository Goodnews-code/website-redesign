    <div class="article-body"><p>Not so long ago there is a Christian memorial service so large that it nearly fills a football stadium. Millions watch live on television.</p>
<p>The widow speaks about her husband and the man who took aim  and shot him. She struggles with the words and then says softly, &quot;That young  man....&quot; Then louder and firmly, &quot;I forgive him!&quot; The huge crowd rises to its feet and applauds for nearly a minute, tears running down the faces of many. &quot;The answer to hate,&quot; she continues, &quot;is not hate. The answer we know from the gospel is love, and always love. Love for our enemies and those who persecute us.&quot;</p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/77018ac7_manifesto_top_468x100.jpg" alt="Sermon on the Mount, The Jesus Manifesto, Matthew 5-7" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Sermon on the Mount, The Jesus Manifesto, Matthew 5-7</figcaption></figure>
<p>As the service continues, two dozen prominent figures eulogize the deceased. Near the end, a well-known leader gives tribute. Then he says, &quot;I disagree [with the deceased]. Ihatemy opponent!&quot; The crowd laughs. &quot;And Idon&#x27;twant my best for them!&quot; Laughter. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry!&quot; He grins. Sensing the crowd with him, he chuckles and smiles as he muses about what the deceased would have thought of such venom.</p>
<p>To this day I am struck by these polar opposites -- the widow and the leader.</p>
<p>This prompts me to go back and see what Jesus actuallydoesteach about love, hate, and revenge. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says:</p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/0be0d669_rose-vase-82x300.gif" alt="Rose in vase." loading="lazy"><figcaption>Rose in vase.</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;You have heard that it was said, &#x27;Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.&#x27; But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,that you may be sons of your Father in heaven.&quot; (Matthew 5:43-45a)</blockquote>
<p>Jesus says that a reciprocal sort of love isn&#x27;t remarkable at all. It is nothing more than how despised tax collectors and utter pagans react. But Jesus&#x27; followers are called to a higher standard.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.&quot; (Matthew 5:46-48)</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Nobody&#x27;s perfect,&quot; people reply, trying to shrug off  Jesus&#x27; words. But their excuses ring hollow. Jesus calls us upward to a new kind of love.</p>
<p>The essential underlying theme of the entire Christian faith is love.God&#x27;s love for the sinful world. Grace that overwhelms with boundless measure the punishment we deserve for our sins.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Friendship with the world is hatred toward God. Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.&quot; (James 4:4)</blockquote>
<p>Wewereonce enemies of Jesus, resisting his kingship and living by a completely different value system. But that doesn&#x27;t stop God from loving us. &quot;For God so loved the world that he gave....&quot;</p>
<p>When you think about it,Christianity is not just about love, but love for enemies.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Christ died for the ungodly.... God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; (Romans 5:6b, 8)</blockquote>
<p>What does loving enemies look like? It is two-fold: (1) withholding revenge towards our enemies and (2) showing generosity towards them. Our natural reaction is to get even. Give tit for tat. Eye for an eye. Jesus address this.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;You have heard that it was said,&#x27;Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.&#x27;But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person.If someone strikes you on the right cheek,turn to him the other also.&quot; (Matthew 5:38-39)</blockquote>
<p>Some see Jesus as teaching passivism here. I think that misses the point. This is hyperbole. Jesus is saying: refuse to retaliate a blow by punching back harder. Rather, find ways to do positive good toward those who are trying to harm you and take advantage of you. This is reinforced by the examples Jesus gives to illustrate the point.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;If someone wants to sue you and take your tunic,let him have your cloak as well.If someone forces you to go one mile,go with him two miles.&quot; (Matthew 5:40-41)</blockquote>
<p>Jesus calls us to show generosity towards our enemies rather than spite.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul teaches this same truth.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;17Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody.18If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.19Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God&#x27;s wrath, for it is written: &#x27;It is mine to avenge; I will repay,&#x27; says the Lord. [Deuteronomy 32:35] On the contrary:&#x27;If your enemy is hungry, feed him;if he is thirsty, give him something to drink.In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.&#x27; [Proverbs 25:21-22]21Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.&quot; (Romans 12:17--21)</blockquote>
<p>Consider that last line.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.&quot; (Romans 12:21)</blockquote>
<p>If we allow ourselves to disobey Jesus and seek revenge, then we open our souls to Satan&#x27;s corruption. The fuel for revenge is not really justice, but hate. This is the same spirit I see in the dragon&#x27;s enraged attack upon Christ and all his followers in the allegory in Revelation 12 (Revelation 12:17). Either we follow the way of love and become like Jesus, or we follow the way of selfish, angry enmity and become bitter angry people ourselves.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t help but think of the young widow at the memorial  service speaking about her husband&#x27;s killer. She said:</p>
<p>&quot;On the cross our Savior said, &#x27;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.&#x27; That man ... that young man ... I forgive him!&quot;</p>
<p>Unforgettable. We are called to love no matter how hard. This is  Jesus&#x27; way. This is the gospel.</p></div>
