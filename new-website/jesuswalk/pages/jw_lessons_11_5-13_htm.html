<p>I&#x27;ve experienced legendary &quot;Southern hospitality,&quot; but even  that is exceeded by Middle Eastern hospitality.</p>
<p>When I was a pastor in Southern California, we had a family  in our congregation from Lebanon -- wonderful people and wonderful hosts. I  learned much about Middle Eastern hospitality from them. When I would visit the  family, they would invite me in and go to the kitchen to prepare for me some of  their traditional thick, sweet coffee in a tiny cup. The wife would get special  cookies to serve me, and then would pour the thick coffee. What was strange to  me was that the refreshments were usually for me alone. They did not partake  with me. Their hospitality was their way of honoring me as their guest. In the  Middle East, hospitality is more than the courteous thing to do; it is an  important obligation. To neglect hospitality to a guest is unthinkable. This is  the background of Jesus&#x27; Parable of the Friend at Midnight (11:5-8).</p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/c3de8d06_william-holman-hunt-the-importunate-neighbor-350x242.jpg" alt="William Holman Hunt, &#x27;The Importunate Neighbor&#x27; (1895), National Gallery of Victoria, Australia" loading="lazy"><figcaption>William Holman Hunt, &#x27;The Importunate Neighbor&#x27; (1895), National Gallery of Victoria, Australia</figcaption></figure>
<p>&quot;Then he said to them, &#x27;Suppose one of you has a  friend, and he goes to him at midnight and says, &quot;Friend, lend me three loaves  of bread, because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have  nothing to set before him.&quot;&#x27;&quot; (11:5-6)</p>
<p>Jesus was raised in a culture where hospitality was a high  value. The Jewish people from Abraham on down honored their guests:</p>
<p>With such a high value -- and no corner convenience stores --  you can imagine the acute sense of anxiety of the man whose friend arrives for a  visit about midnight. He MUST feed his visitor. That he has no bread in his  house is no excuse.</p>
<p>Jesus paints the picture in a few strokes and his listeners  can place themselves in the same situation.</p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/b46ec938_luke-cover-114x140.gif" alt="Discipleship Training in Luke&#x27;s Gospel, by Dr. Ralph F. Wilson" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Discipleship Training in Luke&#x27;s Gospel, by Dr. Ralph F. Wilson</figcaption></figure>
<p>So the man goes to his neighbor&#x27;s house and calls to his  neighbor inside, probably waking him, and appeals to him as a friend. The Greek  word used isphilos, an adjective that means, &quot;loved, dear, loving,  kindly disposed, devoted&quot; as well as a noun, as found in our verse, &quot;friend.&quot;438It is the way a person addresses one with whom he is on good terms.</p>
<p>Friendship is one of the important elements of this parable.  Notice that the word &quot;friend&quot; is used four times in these few verses:</p>
<p>&quot;Then he said to them, &#x27;Suppose one of you has  afriend, and he goes to him at midnight and says, &quot;Friend, lend  me three loaves of bread, because afriendof mine on a journey has come  to me, and I have nothing to set before him.&#x27;&quot;Then the one inside answers, &#x27;Don&#x27;t bother me. The door is already locked, and  my children are with me in bed. I can&#x27;t get up and give you anything.&#x27; I tell  you, though he will not get up and give him the bread because he is hisfriend, yet because of the man&#x27;s boldness he will get up and give him as  much as he needs.&quot; (11:5-8)</p>
<p>Jesus point is this: As strong as the bond of friendship is,  it isn&#x27;t strong enough to get the man out of his bed in the middle of the night.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Then the one inside answers, &#x27;Don&#x27;t bother me. The  door is already locked, and my children are with me in bed. I can&#x27;t get up and  give you anything.&#x27;&quot; (11:7)</blockquote>
<p>The typical poor Israelite family lived in a one-room house.  And in many poorer homes, the house also served as a part-time stable for the  family&#x27;s few sheep, goats, and chickens. All family members would sleep in the  same room, sometimes on a raised platform, perhaps 18 inches higher than the  floor of the rest of the house, so the family could eat and sleep without  constant intrusions by their animals. Family members usually slept with their  clothes on, covering themselves with the cloaks they had worn during the day.  They would bed down side-by-side on straw mats rolled out at night.439</p>
<p>Getting a whole family to bed was a considerable undertaking,  as parents know. Once children are asleep, parents want to keep them that way.  Once the chickens were asleep, parents would want to keep them that way.</p>
<p>The door was locked, too. The Greek word iskleiō,  &quot;shut, lock, bar.&quot; Of structures, &quot;close, lock.&quot;440The poorest homes would have a bar across the door to prevent the  leather-hinged wood door from opening. Some wealthier homes may have been equipped with a  primitive wooden lock using two- or three-pegged keys that would allow a bar to  be lifted from its socket from the outside.441</p>
<p>Since the door was locked, the friend couldn&#x27;t just let  himself in and get the bread he needed. The father would have to get up quietly  from the sleeping area, find the bread in the food storage area, and cross the  area where the animals were near the door, unlock the door, and give the bread  to his neighbor. There would be no way to keep the household from waking up.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;I tell you, though he will not get up and give him  the bread because he is his friend, yet because of the man&#x27;s boldness he will  get up and give him as much as he needs.&quot; (11:8)</blockquote>
<p>As strong as his friendship with the man is, it isn&#x27;t strong  enough for him to wake up his whole family. But the man&#x27;s &quot;boldness&quot; tips the  scale in Jesus&#x27; parable. The Greek word is the nounanaideia,  &quot;persistence, impudence,&quot; literally, &quot;shamelessness,&quot; from the verbanaideuomai, &quot;be unabashed, bold,&quot; literally &quot;shameless.&quot;442</p>
<p>The point of the parable, of course, is the importance of  persistence, of never giving up. But Jesus&#x27; expression, &quot;because of the man&#x27;sshamelessness&quot; is remarkable. The friend has no sense of decency of waiting  until morning, of not disturbing his sleeping neighbor. He goes at midnight and  knocks -- for some bread! And he shamelessly keeps on knocking until his neighbor  gets up and shoves bread at him just to shut him up. Shamelessness! Brashness!  Boldness! Chutzpah! That&#x27;s what the parable illustrates.</p>
<p>By this time, Jesus&#x27; hearers are chuckling. The picture Jesus  has painted has them imagining the man out the outside pounding, and the  neighbor inside stumbling over children and chickens in order to get bread to  the door as fast as he can. It is a humorous story. But now Jesus makes the  point.</p>
<p>&quot;So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you;  seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone  who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be  opened.&quot; (11:9-10)</p>
<p>Jesus gives us three word pairs that have to do with prayer.  The first is the action, the second is the result. The first word in each pair  is in the Greek present tense that can carry the idea of &quot;action in progress in  present time,&quot; the &quot;Progressive Present.&quot;443Jesus&#x27; command here has the effect of saying, &quot;Do this (and keep on doing it).&quot;  The second word in each pair is in the future tense, the expectation, the  promise.</p>
<p>The Greek words used in Jesus&#x27; command are common. Greekaiteōmeans &quot;ask, ask for, demand.&quot;444In the case of a superior speaking to an inferior it can carry the idea  &quot;demand,&quot; as in an accounting. But here the idea is &quot;ask for, petition.&quot; The  promise is Greekdidōmi, the common word for &quot;give.&quot; &quot;Ask and it will be  given to you.&quot;</p>
<p>Greekzēteōmeans, &quot;&#x27;seek, look for&#x27; in order to find.&quot;  It can be used literally, as the woman seeking for a lost coin (Luke 15:8), or  figuratively &quot;try to obtain, desire to possess something ... strive for, aim  (at), desire, wish.&quot;445The corresponding result is expressed by Greekeuriskō(from which  Californians get their state Motto, &quot;Eureka! -- I have found it&quot;). It means  literally &quot;find, discover, come upon,&quot; and can also refer figuratively to  &quot;intellectual discovery based upon reflection, observation, examination, or  investigation.&quot;446&quot;Seek and you will find.&quot;</p>
<p>The third pair of words express the figure of seeking by  knocking on a door until it is opened, just like Jesus&#x27; parable of The Friend at  Midnight. &quot;Knock and the door will be opened to you.&quot;</p>
<p>Are these three word pairs each designed to express something  different? Should we seek the distinctions between them? They seem to me to be a  good example of Hebrew synonymous parallelism. Each reinforces the other in the  ways we are encouraged to think of our seeking from God -- of petitions, of  finding what eludes us, and of obtaining an audience with the person inside. We  are to pray -- for each of these three are ways of talking about prayer -- without  ceasing. We are to pray &quot;shamelessly,&quot; if you will. In season and out of season,  not flagging in our prayers until we receive the promise, or until God answers  or directs us to pray differently.</p>
<p>Jesus teaches a similar lesson in the Parable of the  Persistent Widow (Luke 18:1-8), where the parable is told &quot;to show [his  disciples] that they should always pray and not give up.&quot; I don&#x27;t know about  you, but I need this lesson of persistent, faithful, unstopping petition until  the answer is received.</p>
<p>Of course, God can tell us &quot;No!&quot; and sometimes does. The  Apostle Paul had a &quot;thorn in the flesh,&quot; some kind of affliction from Satan --  whether physical or mental or external opposition we do not know. Paul pleads  with the Lord three times to take it away, but then receives the answer, &quot;My  grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness&quot; (2  Corinthians 12:7-10). Paul accepts this answer, and now begins to glory in his  weaknesses that Christ&#x27;s power may rest on him.</p>
<p>After college, I was drafted into the US Army at the height  of the Vietnam War, and, due to my degree in biology, was stationed at Fort  Dietrich, Maryland, in a research laboratory. After a while, I remember getting  excited about going to seminary. I sent for all sorts of seminary catalogs and  would pore over their pages trying to figure out where I&#x27;d like to go. One day I  distinctly remember the Lord saying to me something that I can only translate in  the vernacular: &quot;Cool it!&quot; He didn&#x27;t want me looking at seminary catalogs, so I  put them away. It was as if the Lord was telling me to move on, not to linger  here. Not to push it. A couple of years later, Jean and I found ourselves living  one mile from Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. We had moved there to  accept a job at Cal Tech, but God had other plans for us that I hadn&#x27;t even  thought of. His answer to my seminary quest wasn&#x27;t &quot;No,&quot; but &quot;Not now, not this  way.&quot; He had his own way of leading me. And it was very good. I can&#x27;t think of  another seminary in the country that would have prepared me better for a  cross-denominational ministry of Bible teaching. God knew. I didn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>But how can we pray confidently, boldly, if God may have  something else in mind for us? How can we know we are praying according to God&#x27;s  will? And if we don&#x27;t know, how can we pray at all?</p>
<p>In the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus prayed, &quot;Not my will but  thine be done.&quot; Isn&#x27;t that a safer kind of prayer? Instead of energetically  praying for what we desire, believing God wants to give it to us, shouldn&#x27;t we  rather pray passively, &quot;Do your will, not mine&quot;?</p>
<p>Yes and no. Yes, we should always be seeking the Father&#x27;s  will, as the Lord&#x27;s Prayer teaches us: &quot;Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on  earth as it is in heaven.&quot; But no, we are not to stop at praying for the  Father&#x27;s will; we are definitely to ask for our own needs, too -- &quot;our daily  bread.&quot; And to pray persistently until we receive an answer.</p>
<p>When Jesus prays in Gethsemane, he knows that it is the  Father&#x27;s will that he go to the cross, but he prays in order to find another  way, if that is possible (Luke 22:39-46). He agonizes in prayer for some time  seeking for another way besides the cross. Matthew tells us that he prays this  prayer three times (Matthew 26:36-44). He knows the cross is what the Father has  shown him. But he seeks some other way. Finally, the Father shows him no other  way and he is content to say, &quot;Yet not my will, but yours be done.&quot; And God  sends angels to strengthen him as he follows the very difficult path the Father  has directed him on.</p>
<p>Jesus&#x27; own prayer is earnest. He asks and seeks and knocks  again and again. This isn&#x27;t any wishy-washy &quot;whatever you want&quot; prayer that  requires no intensity. Jesus is wholly involved in seeking. And in the end he  finds the answer he seeks. There is no other way to redeem us except for him to  die on the cross for our sins. He has asked and he has received. He has searched  and he has found.</p>
<p>We are encouraged to ask boldly, knowing that we can trust  God. The writer of Hebrews encourages us,</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so  that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.&quot;  (Hebrews 4:16)</blockquote>
<p>The word translated &quot;confidence&quot; (NIV) or  &quot;boldness&quot; (KJV) is Greekparrēsia, &quot;outspokenness, frankness, plainness&quot;  of speech that conceals nothing and passes over nothing. It can also carry the  ideas of &quot;courage, confidence, boldness, fearlessness,&#x27; especially in the  presence of persons of high rank.&quot;447</p>
<p>We aren&#x27;t to pray with a whimper or a whine or a whisper. No.  We are to come with a confident asking, seeking, knocking. God our Father  desires to hear our petitions and we are entirely open with him. Prayer is not a  time to hide what is going on inside us, but to share it openly -- warts and all  -- with our Father, whom we know loves us and understands us and seeks good for  us. We can trust him, even though we might misunderstand an issue, or ask for  the wrong thing.</p>
<p>You may have heard the somewhat cynical saying, &quot;Be careful  what you ask for; you might just get it.&quot; But that idea isn&#x27;t found in the  Bible. It assumes that God may smugly give us what he knows isn&#x27;t good for us,  just to show that we are stupid. The fear that we aren&#x27;t praying for the right  things can paralyze us, and keep us from praying earnestly at all.</p>
<p>&quot;Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish,  will give him a snake instead? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a  scorpion? If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your  children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those  who ask him!&quot; (11:11-13)</p>
<p>Trust your Father to give you good gifts, even when you ask  incompletely or perhaps wrongly. He is not peevish or petulant. He loves you.</p>
<p>Notice that in 11:13a Jesus characterizes us humans as &quot;evil&quot;  (Greekponēros). He doesn&#x27;t assume the basic goodness of man, but the  basic evil. Nevertheless, our Father does not return evil for evil, but good  even when we might be praying selfishly.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t ever, ever fear to pray to your Father. You can trust  him to do you good, and not evil. Jesus says so.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;... how much more will your Father in heaven give  the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!&quot; (11:13b)</blockquote>
<p>Here Jesus uses the title &quot;Father in heaven.&quot; But where we  would expect Jesus to say that the Father gives good gifts to his children (as  he does in Matthew 7:11), Jesus tells them that the Father will give them the  Holy Spirit if they ask him. Wow! In the Old Testament, the gift of the Spirit  was sparse and sporadic. The Spirit was upon Moses and Samuel, upon Saul and  David and the prophets. And one time the Spirit came upon the Seventy Elders who  were to assist Moses. Moses says wistfully on that occasion,</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;I wish that all the Lord&#x27;s people were prophets and that the  Lord would put his Spirit on them!&quot; (Numbers 11:29)</blockquote>
<p>Moses&#x27; longing is answered in Jesus Christ who gives us his  Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the Father&#x27;s very best gift. It is the gift of  himself to dwell with us and within us forever. How marvelous! Do you long for a  full portion of the Holy Spirit? Jesus promises that your Father in heaven will  give you the Holy Spirit if you ask him.</p>
<p>So don&#x27;t be satisfied with where you are or what you have.  Your Father is wealthy beyond all imagination. And he wants to meet your needs  with abundance, &quot;according to his glorious riches&quot; (Philippians 4:19). So speak  up, my disciple friend. Now is not the time to be shy in his presence. Now is  the time to joyously and expectantly ask and seek and knock in prayer to your  Father. Don&#x27;t stop. Don&#x27;t quit. Expect his best gifts to be yours.</p>
<p>Heavenly Father, how I have needed to hear this message  myself. Some things I have just stopped praying about. I&#x27;ve gotten discouraged  and lazy. Forgive me. And fill me afresh with a bold faith filled with visions  of the possibilities you desire to create through my prayers. I pray for my  fellow disciples also. Teach us to really pray and incorporate bold,  faith-filled praying into our very lives. For the sake of your Kingdom! I pray  in Jesus&#x27; name. Amen.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will  find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives;  he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.&quot; (Luke  11:9-10)</blockquote>
