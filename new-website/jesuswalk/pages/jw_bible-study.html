<p>Every sincere Christian wants to have a more meaningful personal Bible study, to understand the Bible better. While learning the Bible is the joyful task of a lifetime, I&#x27;d like to offer several suggestions that can enrich your Bible studies.</p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/27d4c936_30757276student133x200.jpg" alt="Write down what you learn in your Bible study" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Write down what you learn in your Bible study</figcaption></figure>
<p>Recognize that Bible reading and Bible study are both important, but different. In order to grow, you need to read the Bible every day as part of your time with God -- your devotions or Quiet Time.  But taking time for more in-depth study is also important so you really  understand what is going on.More on  reading vs. study.</p>
<p>The real key to Bible study is being inquisitive, learning to ask questions of the text. First, read the passage. Then be a detective; look for clues. What&#x27;s going on? What stands out to you? What don&#x27;t you understand?More  in asking questions of the text.</p>
<p>One main difference between reading and studying is writing down what you learn. This isn&#x27;t just so you&#x27;ll remember it later. The very act of writing requires you to formulate your thoughts clearly. Writing forces you to recognize fuzzy thinking for what it is and push beyond it. Write down  what your learning because it helps you understand it better. I recommend  starting a simple Bible study journal for your studies.More on  a Bible study journal.</p>
<p>I amso gladI began the habit of note-taking with my Bible study. Now when I study a passage again, I know what I learned the last time I studied it and what I need to explore next. For Bible teachers, small group leaders, and preachers, such a notebook of previous studies becomes especially valuable.</p>

<p>One of the keys to Bible study is to get a good modern translation. You know, of course, that the Bible wasn&#x27;t written in English, but in Hebrew (and a bit of Aramaic) in the Old Testament and Greek in the New Testament. A  good translation tries to render the original languages into clear, accurate,  understandable English. There are two types of translations:</p>
<p>The New International Version (NIV) is a great balancebetween word-for-word  and readability. That&#x27;s why I use it for preaching and as the basic text for my  online Bible studies.More on  Bible translations.</p>
<p>A good study Bible is a modern translation that contains a number of extra  aids to study -- cross references, Bible book introductions, study notes or  annotations, a concordance, a topical index, and maps.More on a study  Bible.</p>
<p>Obtaining  a study Bible is the place to begin. But as your Bible studies increase, you may  want to invest in some more specialized books. Some to explore are: a Bible  handbook, Bible dictionary, Bible concordance, Bible commentary, word study  tools, a topical Bible, and a Bible atlas.More on  Bible study tools.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s possible to be so engrossed in Bible study that you forget the most  important purpose of Bible study.  It&#x27;s not Bible knowledge for its own sake nor being able to quote verses and recite orthodox doctrine. Ultimately, the purpose of Bible study is to learn exactly what the Bible teaches so that you canapply its teachings to your life.</p>
<p>Perhaps the simplest approach to Bible study is to use the three basic inductive Bible study questions to ask of a Bible passage:</p>
<p>My prayer is that your Bible study results in a heart that is tender to listen to what the Spirit is saying to you through Scripture and a will that is determined to live out  in your everyday life what you&#x27;re learning.</p>
