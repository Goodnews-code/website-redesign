<p>An angel speaks to Cornelius, the Gentile centurion stationed in the coastal city of Caesarea. He&#x27;s a regular attender at the local Jewish synagogue, though you would call him a &quot;God-fearer,&quot; rather than a full convert to Judaism. He is earnest. He prays. He gives alms. His heart is strong after God.</p>

<p>One afternoon -- about the time the evening sacrifice is being offered miles away in the temple in Jerusalem -- Cornelius is praying. Suddenly, he has a vision. An angel announces:</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering1before God.&quot; (Acts 10:4)</blockquote>
<p>The angel is comparing Cornelius&#x27;s prayers and righteous deeds to the temple offering of fine flour and oil that is burned with frankincense on the altar producing a sweet-smelling &quot;pleasant aroma&quot; to the Lord (Leviticus 2:2, 9, 16; 5:12). Incense!</p>

<p>David says something similar:</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;May myprayerbe set before you likeincense;may thelifting up of my handsbe like theevening sacrifice.&quot; (Psalm 141:2)</blockquote>
<p>Paul says of the gifts the Philippian church have sent to support his ministry:</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;They are afragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God&quot; (Philippians 4:18)</blockquote>
<p>In Revelation, they offer before the throne &quot;golden bowls full ofincense, which are theprayers of the saints&quot; (Revelation 5:8; cf. 8:3-4). These prayers smell sweet to the Lord.</p>
<p>Those who love the Lord spend time in prayer before him. They show compassion to the hurting. They help those in need. They serve on the Lord&#x27;s behalf. And this is right!</p>
<p>But have you ever thought of it from God&#x27;s point of view? That our prayers and service are sweet to him, like a fragrant incense before him.</p>
<p>Eric Liddell, a strong Christian and Olympic runner whose life is depicted in the Oscar-winning film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981), is quoted as saying:</p>
<p>&quot;I believe God made me for a purpose,but he also made me fast!And when I run I feel his pleasure.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, to live our lives to bring pleasure to our Lord!</p>
<p>My friend, you often struggle. Many times you can only see  your sins and short-comings. Sometimes, all you can seem do is stand your ground and trust God. Sometimes, you don&#x27;t even think about the lady you prayed for, the family you helped, the song you sang to the Lord in your devotional time.</p>
<p>But God who has redeemed you looks at your life and is pleased.  He doesn&#x27;t view you with judgment, but with a Father&#x27;s love. Your prayers are sweet to him for they show your humble faith. Your acts of kindness bring joy to him because they demonstrate that you&#x27;ve internalized his Son&#x27;s values. They bring him joy. He rejoices in the baby steps and, later, the long strides of spiritual  adolescence. They are like the hint of incense on the evening breeze. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>So keep on. Don&#x27;t quit even when it is hard. Paul the Apostle and his friend Silas are severely beaten -- flogged. And yet from the inner cells you can hear them singing hymns to Jesus at midnight.2Incense. Paul reminds us,</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Therefore, my beloved brothers and sisters,3be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:58)</blockquote>
<p>References and Abbreviations</p>
<p>[1]&quot;Memorial offering&quot; (NIV) ismnēmosunon, &quot;memory,&quot; here, &quot;an offering that presents a worshiper to God, a memorial offering.&quot; The same Greek word is found in the Greek Septuagint in Leviticus 2:2, 9, 16: 5:12 to translateʾazkārâ. In Leviticus 2:2, &quot;memorial portion&quot; (ESV, NIV), &quot;token portion&quot; (NRSV), &quot;the memorial of it&quot; (KJV) ʾazkārâ, &quot;memorial portion,&quot; fromzākar, &quot;to remember, recollect.&quot; It is the technical term for that portion of the cereal offering which was burned as God&#x27;s share. Its derivation indicates a meaning such as &quot;memorial&quot; or &quot;remembrance&quot; (Andrew Bowling, TWOT #551d). Holladay (p. 8) offers &quot;suggested  meanings: reminiscence; summons; invocation; sign-offering.&quot;</p>
<p>[3]The plural ofadelphos, &quot;brother,&quot; can mean &quot;brothers and sisters&quot; (BDAG 18, 1).</p>
