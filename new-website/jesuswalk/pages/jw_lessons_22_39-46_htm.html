<p>If you&#x27;re missing a lesson or audio link, or can&#x27;t find something else, here is a comprehensive  list of links to all the lessons and materials forDiscipleship Training in Luke&#x27;s  Gospel.</p>
<p>In this series we look at the Passion of our Lord Jesus, his betrayal, the  Last Supper, his prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, Peter&#x27;s denial, Jesus&#x27;  trials and crucifixion, and the thief on the cross. It concludes with Jesus&#x27;  glorious resurrection, appearances to his disciples, his Great Commission, and  his ascension. Overall, it tells the story of the core of the gospel message  that the Apostle Paul characterizes as the basics of the gospel:</p>
<p>&quot;For what I received I passed on to you as of first  importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he  was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:3-4)</p>

<p>If you&#x27;re not already working through the entire book of Luke to deepen your  life as a disciple, this might be a great series to study during the six-week  season of Lent, studying 3 lessons per week of the 6-week Lenten period that  leads up to Resurrection Sunday.</p>
<p>Judas&#x27; Betrayal(21:37-22:1-6).Audio (28:15)</p>
<p>Unlike most studies of Luke, I&#x27;ve chosen to conclude with the  accounts of Jesus&#x27; birth rather than begin there. That is because I&#x27;ve been  trying to emphasize Jesus&#x27; disciple-training mission.</p>
<p>However, from Luke&#x27;s perspective as an evangelist, the  infancy narratives are important because they help the reader understand just  who Jesus is. He is the Messiah, conceived by the Holy Spirit and born into a  loving human family.</p>
<p>Jesus is not just a precocious young man who rose to great  renown. He was sent from the Father into this world for a particular mission  that would climax with the cross and salvation. As you study the story of these  events, you&#x27;ll appreciate more Jesus&#x27; birth as part of God&#x27;s plan from  throughout the ages.</p>
