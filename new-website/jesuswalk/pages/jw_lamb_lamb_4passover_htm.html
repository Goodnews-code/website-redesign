<p>The Apostle Paul writes, &quot;Christ, our Passover lamb, has been  sacrificed&quot; (1 Corinthians 5:7), echoing the early church&#x27;s  belief that Christ was a fulfillment of the Passover or Paschal  lamb (from Hebrewpesach, &quot;passover&quot;).</p>

<p>As I study the New Testament, I am becoming more and more  convinced that Jesus, too, saw himself in this role, and implies  as much in his words at the Last Supper -- which, it turns out,  were shared in the context of an actual Passover meal. Let&#x27;s  explore this aspect of Christ&#x27;s ministry of atonement as the  Passover Lamb. To do this, we need to go back thirteen or  fourteen centuries before Christ to the people of Israel when  they were slaves in Egypt.</p>
<p>As God begins to deliver Israel from Egypt, he sends Moses to  Pharaoh with the demand, &quot;Let my people go!&quot; Pharaoh refuses.  Following each refusal, God sends plagues of increasing severity  upon Egypt, culminating with God&#x27;s decree that each firstborn son  in Egypt would be slain (Exodus 11:5). But when Moses declares  God&#x27;s words to Pharaoh, Pharaoh refuses to believe them.</p>
<p>To protect from this plague the Israelites who lived in Egypt,  God instructs Moses that each household should select a yearling  male lamb and slaughter it at dusk on the 14th day of Abib (the  Hebrew month that corresponds with March-April).</p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/fe41bf20_van_mol_jesuscup300x316.jpg" alt="Pieter van Mol, &#x27;St. John the Evangelist&#x27;" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Pieter van Mol, &#x27;St. John the Evangelist&#x27;</figcaption></figure>
<p>During the night the angel of death passes through Egypt  slaying the firstborn of both men and animals to bring judgment  on Pharaoh and the gods of Egypt.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;When the LORDgoes through the land  to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top  and sides of the doorframe and will pass over (pasach)  that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter  your houses and strike you down&quot; (Exodus 12:23)</blockquote>
<p>The Hebrew verb used in these verses ispāsach. While  there are several theories about the meaning of this verb, two  seem most plausible. The traditional etymology is the meaning &quot;to  pass (over),&quot;1that is, the merciful passing over of a  destructive power. Some interpretpāsachas meaning &quot;to  defend, protect,&quot; that is, &quot;the Lord will protectively cover the  houses of the Israelites and will not allow the destroyer to  enter.&quot;2In either case, the blood is a sign to the  Lord that the house that bears it should be exempted from the  judgment on the firstborn.</p>
<p>Just what kind of sacrifice is the initial Paschal lamb  offered at the Exodus? It is not like the scapegoat on the Day of  Atonement (Leviticus 16) or one of the morning and evening  offerings (Exodus 29:38-43; Numbers 28:1-8). Most of these  offerings were to atone for sin in some sense, while the  commemorative sacrifice of Passover lambs in the temple each year  was not considered as an atonement for sin.3</p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/52fff332_lamb-cover-92x140.gif" alt="" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>But what was the significance of the initial sacrifice of  Passover lambs at thefirstPassover? Five offerings were  performed in the tabernacle and, later, in the temple.4Of these, Old Testament scholar Richard Averbeck observes that  the sacrifice of the Passover lamb bears some resemblance to the  peace or fellowship offering. In this type of offering, a  representative piece of meat is offered before the Lord and to  the priests. The rest is eaten by the offerer and his family as a  kind of celebration meal -- similar to the celebration meal of  the Passover. Averbeck also notes similarities between the  original Passover act of placing blood on the doorpost and lintel  and the ordination of priests, where blood is placed on the  priest&#x27;s ear, right thumb, and right big toe as an act of  consecration (Leviticus 8:23-24). He sees the initial Passover  offering as a consecration or setting apart of the people within  each household who partook of the sacrifice.5</p>
<p>Israel&#x27;s sin doesn&#x27;t seem to be in the forefront; rather, the  lamb seems to be a kind of substitute or interposition for the  firstborn males and animals in the household. However, there may  be some idea of expiation or purification present since hyssop is  used to smear the blood. Elsewhere hyssop is associated with  expiation and purification.6In addition, some  Rabbinical writings refer to the redemptive effect of the blood  of the Passover lamb.7</p>
<p>Jews were instructed to partake of the Passover annually to  celebrate and commemorate God redeeming them from slavery in  Egypt. By Jesus&#x27; day, Passover was to be celebrated only within  the precincts of Jerusalem, so the city was jam-packed with  pilgrims during this season.</p>
<p>There is some question whether the Last Supper Jesus held with  his disciples was a Passover meal or a special meal the day  before Passover. The Synoptic Gospels are pretty clear that the  Last Supper was a Passover meal (Mark 14:12; Luke 22:13-15), but  the chronology of John&#x27;s Gospel seems to indicate that Jesus was  crucified just before Passover began (John 18:28). These can  probably be harmonized by assuming the use of different calendars  among the Jews.8However, I&#x27;m convinced that the Last  Supper was indeed held on Passover as part of the Passover meal.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s look at some of the elements of the Passover meal as it  might have been held in Jesus&#x27; day:9Each element of  the meal was blessed and then commented upon (thehaggadah)  by the head of the household, in this case, Jesus.</p>
<p>This was a very special meal, since neither wine nor meat were  common as everyday fare. Here is a reconstruction of the meal  based on the research of New Testament scholar Joachim Jeremias.10</p>
<p>If this outline of the Passover meal at the Last Supper is  accurate, then Jesus&#x27; words about the bread being his body and  the cup being his blood are immediately adjacent to eating the  Passover lamb. I can&#x27;t escape the conclusion that Jesus&#x27; words  were interpreted by his disciples -- and probably intended by  Jesus -- to be understood in relation to the Passover and the  Passover lamb.11Clearly the early church thought of  Jesus as the Passover or Paschal Lamb that had been sacrificed (1  Corinthians 5:7). Perhaps the analogy is: Jesus interposes  himself to redeem his people from their bondage to sin, just as  the Passover lamb was interposed to redeem the people of Israel  from slavery in Egypt.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear that what we call Jesus&#x27; &quot;words of  institution&quot; use clear sacrificial language.</p>
<p>The words of institution are found with some variations in  Matthew 26:26-28, Mark 14:22-24; Luke 22:19-20; and 1 Corinthians  11:24-25. While I can&#x27;t be exhaustive, let&#x27;s briefly examine  Matthew&#x27;s account. Most striking to me in this passage are Jesus  words: &quot;This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for  many for the forgiveness of sins.&quot;</p>
<p>This would be startling to anyone, especially to Jews who were  prohibited from drinking blood (Leviticus 17:10-11). In John  6:53-57 such offensive words caused some disciples to leave Jesus  and no longer follow him (John 6:66). Coupled with Jesus asking  the disciples to eat bread that he identified as his body, we  have a remarkable and powerful image. Jesus is asking his  disciples to feed on him (John 6:57) and unite themselves to him  and to his death using a very intimate and powerful figure. How  could the disciples forget such a vivid idea? They couldn&#x27;t.  Jesus intended that they remember.</p>
<p>Though the original manuscripts of Matthew&#x27;s Gospel may have  omitted the word &quot;new,&quot; the concept of a new covenant was surely  in his mind. The concept of the &quot;blood of the covenant&quot; is found  in Exodus 27:7-8, where blood is sprinkled over the people of  Israel when they agree to the original covenant they were making  with Yahweh at the foot of Mt. Sinai. But the Prophet Jeremiah  heralded the coming of a new covenant of forgiveness of sins  replacing the Mosaic covenant:</p>
<p>As mentioned in Lesson 2 of this series, the phrase &quot;for many&quot;  points back to Isaiah 53:11-12, where the Servant &quot;bore the sin  of many.&quot; Jesus uses the phrase &quot;poured out for many for the  forgiveness of sin.&quot;</p>
<p>To pour out blood in order to obtain forgiveness for another  is clearly the concept of a blood sacrifice. In our day, some who  are offended by this concept seek to reinterpret the meaning of  the Lord&#x27;s Supper, but it&#x27;s pretty hard to hide the truth that  Jesus intended it to remember his death as a sacrifice for sins.</p>
<p>Here Jesus is referring to the Great Banquet alluded to in  both the Old and New Testaments. The Jews of Jesus&#x27; day saw this  as a final or eschatological Passover celebration with Abraham,  Isaac, and Jacob and the other patriarchs and prophets (Luke  13:28-29; 14:15; 22:30; Revelation 19:9)</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed&quot; (1 Corinthians  5:7), and in the Lord&#x27;s Supper we are invited to partake not only  of the sacrifice (see 1 Corinthians 10:16-18), but to celebrate  both our redemption through Christ&#x27;s atonement and his coming  again. The next time you have the privilege of partaking of the  Lord&#x27;s Supper, remember and be thankful.</blockquote>
<p>Just as the Passover lamb was interposed to redeem the people  of Israel from slavery in Egypt, so Jesus interposes himself to  redeem his people from their bondage to sin. Behold, the Lamb of  God who takes away the sin of the world.</p>
<p>Father, thank you for the rich imagery of Christ as our  Passover lamb. Thank you for his willingness to be sacrificed on  our behalf. Thank you for the comfort and hope that we find in  the Lord&#x27;s Supper. And thank you for the expectation we have of  the final Banquet with you. In Jesus&#x27; name, we pray. Amen.</p>
