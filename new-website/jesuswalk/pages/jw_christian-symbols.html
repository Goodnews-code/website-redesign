    <div class="article-body"><p>Christ was often depicted symbolically as theGood Shepherd. Paintings of Jesus didn&#x27;t appear until about  the Fifth Century. Catacombs.</p>
<p>What was early Christianity like? We the archaeology of the Roman catacombs in the second and third centuries AD, give us clues, where the graves of hundreds of thousands of Christians give clues, especially with a number of symbols that reflect the earliest period of the Christian era.</p>

<p>This site contains some photos and drawings of early Christian symbology, with links to many others. Most of these represent Christian visual art prior to 313  A.D., when Emperor Constantine legalized Christianity. During  this time, the cross is seldom seen, except disguised in some way  as an anchor, a trident, or the mast of a ship. Instead,  Christians identified their tombs in the catacombs by other  symbols alongside of funerary inscriptions.</p>
<p>Christian symbols were first mentioned in writing by Clement  of Alexandria (153-217 AD) inPaedogogus3, 11.</p>
<p>It is without question that nearly all Christian symbols are adaptations of pre-Christian symbols. But as Christianity took  hold, these symbols typically lost their pagan associations and  took on Christian meanings. There is a certain sort of believer  that cries &quot;pagan&quot; or &quot;papist&quot; at any Christian symbol, but  that&#x27;s silly. If we were to rid ourselves of every pagan remnant,  we would refuse to use the names of the days of the week or the  months of the year.</p>

<p>Thoughtful twenty-first century Christians look at  the heart and meaning of the symbols as intended by their early  Christian brothers and sisters. We Christians are one with every  other true believer in Christ, no matter what denomination or  doctrinal stance. We look, listen, and learn from a faith that  was forged on persecution and struggle and yet grew and  flourished.</p>
