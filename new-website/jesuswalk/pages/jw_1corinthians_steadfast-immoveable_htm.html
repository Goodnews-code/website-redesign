    <div class="article-body"><p>Last Sunday, our pastor asked the congregation to think of  their favorite verse. Immediately, mine came to mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:58, ESV)</p>

<p>It reminds me of the solidity of Christ and His work, and of my hope in Him. Each time I read it, a smile comes to my face.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s look at it word by word, phrase by phrase.</p>
<p>Therefore.Paul has been talking about the resurrection. He seeks to inspire his Corinthian readers by resurrection&#x27;s guarantee of  eternal life, of reward beyond this life. &quot;Therefore&quot; means: Because of the resurrection, these things are true.1</p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/92e5c8ca_ct-studd-214x225.jpg" alt="C.T. Studd (1860-1931), missionary" loading="lazy"><figcaption>C.T. Studd (1860-1931), missionary</figcaption></figure>
<p>My beloved brothers. The Apostle Paul addresses us as his dear family. The plural ofadelphos(&quot;brother&quot;) here means not only &quot;brothers&quot; but &quot;brothersandsisters.&quot; This is not just a nod to inclusive speech, but actual Greek usage.2We Christians are part of a family that cares deeply for one another. The church is to be the visible expression of that caring love. And though we may sometimes feel alone, we belong to the great family of God -- God our Father, Christ our Brother, the saints who have gone before us, our church family, and you and I.</p>
<p>Be steadfastuses an adjective: &quot;firmly or solidly in  place, firm, steadfast.&quot; It derives from a verb that means &quot;to sit&quot; -- sitting  rather than constantly shifting.3Our confidence in Christ&#x27;s resurrection gives us a firm hope that calms and settles us.</p>
<p>Immovablemeans &quot;not to be moved from place to  place,&quot;4metaphorically, &quot;firmly persistent.&quot;5Some believers are  stubbornly stuck in the past and in their opinions. That&#x27;s unfortunate. But it is good to be stubbornly, doggedly devoted to God so that circumstances and people don&#x27;t distract you from Him. Call it persistent. Call it focused. Call it faithful. There is an African-American spiritual that says it for me, drawing on the imagery of Psalm 1:3 --</p>
<p>&quot;I shall not be, I shall not be moved;I shall not be, I shall not be moved.Just like a tree, planted by the water,Lord, I shall not be moved.&quot;</p>
<p>Always abounding. The word translated &quot;abounding&quot; means &quot;exceeding a fixed number or measure,&quot; &quot;over-and-above.&quot;6Some people live by the philosophy, &quot;Good enough for government work.&quot; They  are  loafers. They do only the minimum -- and only that if the boss or parent or  pastor is looking. Others, out of love, go far beyond. Their lives  pour out, refill, and overflow once more. Not just occasionally. Not just when called on, but  &quot;always.&quot;7</p>
<p>The work of the Lord. The Lord, of course, refers to Jesus Christ our  Master. Paul exhorts each of his Corinthian readers to abound in doing the Lord&#x27;s work. What is &quot;the work8of the Lord&quot;? Here are just a few of the ways we do His work, ways  we build His kingdom here on earth. You&#x27;ll be able to think of many more.</p>
<p>A church is designed to be a caring body. But when loafers don&#x27;t pull their share of the load, the load falls on others to do -- or it just doesn&#x27;t get done at all. Others may shirk, but you remain faithful.</p>
<p>My sister, my brother, this is a word for you: &quot;Always abound in the work of the Lord.&quot; Always. Over-and-above.</p>
<p>Knowing that in the Lord your labor9is not in vain.10Some people hate washing dishes because more dirty dishes magically appear  overnight. Sweeping and vacuuming are the same way. Things never stay clean.  And in the people department, too, people seem to have  continuing problems for us to minister to. There is no end. We can become discouraged.</p>
<p>But God keeps track of our faithfulness to His work. He sees us serving Him when no one else is looking. And when He sees us serving  faithfully, it brings joy to His heart. Our Christian service is not in vain. Rather, it makes a difference -- even if you can&#x27;t see it right now.</p>
<p>C.T. Studd (1860-1931) was a British missionary, one of the &quot;Cambridge Seven&quot; who went to evangelize China with Hudson Taylor. Later, he served in India and the Congo. But perhaps he is best known today for a poem with this memorable refrain:</p>
<p>&quot;Only one life, &#x27;twill soon be past,Only what&#x27;s done for Christ will last.&quot;11</p>
<p>C.T. Studddeliberately invested his lifein God&#x27;s Kingdom.</p>
<p>Yes, sometimes I get discouraged and so do you. But God keeps  bringing us back to 1 Corinthians 15:58 to lift us up and help us to see the  importance of keeping on. Don&#x27;t give up on the church. Don&#x27;t give up on Jesus. Don&#x27;t give up, my friend!</p>
