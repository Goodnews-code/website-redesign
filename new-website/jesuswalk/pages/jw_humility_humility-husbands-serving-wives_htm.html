<p>When the disciples quarrel about who is greatest, Jesus says:</p>

<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.&quot; (Mark 10:43-44)</blockquote>
<p>At the Last Supper, amidst murmurings of who is the greatest (Luke 22:24), Jesus removes his outer garment and -- dressed now like a slave with a towel tied around his waist -- goes from one disciple to another, washing dirty, calloused feet (John 13:1-17).</p>
<p>The disciples are utterly shocked! In the culture of Jesus&#x27; day, common people washed their own feet with a basin and towel provided by the host. Washing someone else&#x27;s feet was considered so low, so menial, that Hebrew slaves couldn&#x27;t be required to do this -- foreign slaves, perhaps, but not Hebrew slaves. A devoted disciple might wash a rabbi&#x27;s feet. A wife might wash a husband&#x27;s feet, perhaps, or a child  his father&#x27;s. But the Master, the Leader, washing his own underlings&#x27; feet? It was unheard of!</p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/c58faaae_ford-maddox-brown-detail-footwashing-275x190.jpg" alt="Ford Madox Brown, detail of &#x27;Jesus Washing Peter&#x27;s Feet&#x27; (1852-56), Tate Gallery, London." loading="lazy"><figcaption>Ford Madox Brown, detail of &#x27;Jesus Washing Peter&#x27;s Feet&#x27; (1852-56), Tate Gallery, London.</figcaption></figure>
<p>His disciples shift in their seats, extremely uncomfortable at what Jesus is doing. It is humiliating for these men. Peter is incensed. &quot;You&#x27;ll never wash my feet!&quot; Jesus rebukes him sharply. When he is finished, Jesus puts his clothes back on, takes his place at the table, and begins to explain.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;You call me &#x27;Teacher&#x27; and &#x27;Lord,&#x27; and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another&#x27;s feet.&quot; (John 13:13-14)</blockquote>
<p>Luke records another word from the upper room.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.&quot; (Luke 22:27)</blockquote>
<p>In Jesus&#x27; Kingdom, the greatest serves the least, the king serves the slave. In Jesus&#x27; Kingdom, we don&#x27;t flaunt position. We don&#x27;t act as if we are too good to perform some menial task. We count serving the least among us as an honor. This is Jesus&#x27; radical message.</p>
<p>What are the implications of all this? As I pondered humility, God surfaced this question in my heart: How humble am I when my wife asks me to do something? Am I quick to serve or resentful that my precious time is being interrupted? Am I really humble before my wife?</p>
<p>Immature husbands might justify themselves by hoisting the flag of headship (Ephesians 5:23). Yet, a sentence or two later, Paul combines home and husbands with Christ and his Church.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church andgave himself up for her....&quot; (Ephesians 5:25a).</blockquote>
<p>He gave himself up. In Jesus&#x27; Kingdom, the Head serves the lowest. For my salvation, Paul  writes,</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;[He] emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.&quot; (Philippians 2:7-8, ESV)</blockquote>
<p>Humility is the profoundly central paradox of Jesus&#x27; Kingdom. Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ takes my pride and position and turns it on its head. May he complete this revolution in me of humbling me and making me a truly humble, willing, service-oriented disciple. May he transform my heart and, my friend, your heart too.</p>
