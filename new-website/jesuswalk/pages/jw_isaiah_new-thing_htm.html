    <div class="article-body"><p>How do you restore hope when life has been utterly shattered? When next year looks as bleak as the one gone by?</p>
<p>Yahweh undertakes this task of restoration of his shattered people by speaking words of hope through his prophet Isaiah. Curiously, in an amazing series of chapters, Isaiah speaks of Judah&#x27;s fall and exile in Babylon long before it even takes place. He then includes the words of encouragement they will need to leave the land of their oppressors and return to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Yahweh calls to his prophet,</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Comfort, comfort my people,says your God.Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,and proclaim to herthat her hard service has been completed....&quot; (Isaiah 40:1-2)</blockquote>
<p>In earlier chapters, Isaiah&#x27;s task has been to call to repentance. Now he becomes the bringer of hope -- centuries in advance.1</p>

<p>You, like Israel of old, may have experienced a difficult season of life, with hope drained by circumstance and heart utterly exhausted by life&#x27;s trials. Here is a word of encouragement from God to you.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;18Forget the former things;do not dwell on the past.19See, I am doing a new thing!Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?I am making a way in the desertand streams in the wasteland.20The wild animals honor me,the jackals and the owls,because I provide water in the desertand streams in the wasteland,to give drink to my people, my chosen,21the people I formed for myselfthat they may proclaim my praise.&quot; (Isaiah 43:18-21)</blockquote>
<p>Let&#x27;s meditate this passage for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Past hurts have a way of crippling us. Deep pain, utter failure, unrelenting anguish. While they are part of our past, God tells us to turn way from these and refuse to let them be our focus going forward.</p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/b518fcf3_jewish-exiles-in-babylon-350x249x72.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>&quot;Forget the former things;do not dwell on the past.&quot; (verse 18)</p>
<p>This prophecy is written in typical poetic Hebrew synonymous parallelism, where the second line tends to amplify the first line, and even carry it forward.</p>
<p>&quot;Forget&quot; (NIV) is probably better &quot;remember not&quot; (ESV, NRSV, KJV).2We can&#x27;t wipe past events from our memory. But we can refuse to constantly call them to mind, to go back to them, and relive them again and again. The second line directs us, &quot;Do not dwell on&quot; (NIV) or &quot;consider&quot; (ESV, NRSV, KJV) the past. The sense of the word is &quot;give one&#x27;s attention to.&quot;3</p>
<p>Some people can&#x27;t seem to move beyond a terrible place with the result that the past event comes to define them. Yes, our past is always there, but if we live there and constantly return to our pain, we can&#x27;t escape it. We must move on. In verse 18, God gently commands us to let it go. He  invites us to move from pain to hope, from defeat to a new future.</p>
<p>Now, the prophet points forward to what our dynamic Creator is in the process of creating.</p>
<p>&quot;See, I am doing a new thing!Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?&quot; (verse 19a)</p>
<p>If we are not careful, harbingers of change can come, but we may miss them if we aren&#x27;t alert. In verse 19, &quot;springs forth&quot; or &quot;springs up&quot; draws on a Hebrew word used to describe growing, budding, sprouting.4New plants. New trees. New things growing in your life. They start with a small seed. You see nothing for a time, and then seemingly overnight a few leaves pop to the surface, and, before you know it, a small plant begins to shoot up.</p>
<p>&quot;... Do you not perceive5it?&quot; (verse 19b)</p>
<p>Can you see it? the prophet asks. Did you miss it? Open up your eyes!</p>
<p>&quot;See, I am doing a new thing!&quot; (verse 19a)</p>
<p>&quot;See&quot; (NIV) or &quot;behold&quot; (ESV, KJV) is a command to pay attention to what God is doing.6The Hebrew word translated here as &quot;doing&quot;7is used frequently of the Maker in the creation accounts in Genesis 1 and 2. The One who speaks worlds into existence is in the process of forming a new future for you. Already the seed has germinated; the new plant is growing. The Creator isn&#x27;t finished with you yet. &quot;His mercies are new every morning. Great is his faithfulness!&quot;8There is hope!</p>
<p>Now the Lord compares this new future he is creating for you to something new in wild and desolate places.</p>
<p>&quot;I am making a way in the desertand streams in the wasteland.&quot; (verse 19b)</p>
<p>In Babylon, God&#x27;s people were living in exile on a fertile river plain between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. But they had crossed the Arabian desert on their forced march to labor in Babylon. They remembered the 40 years in the deserts of the Sinai and Negev after their deliverance from Egypt. They knew all too well about the waterless desert.9In our passage, the desert represents their bleak lives. Their hopelessness. And in their desert experience, God speaks to them.</p>
<p>&quot;I am making10a way in the desertand streams in the wasteland.&quot; (verse 19b)</p>
<p>The verb &quot;make/making&quot; is interesting. The basic idea of this word is to deliberately put or place something in a location. In the very place of your despair -- in the arid expanse of your hopelessness -- God is placing a two-fold miracle,</p>
<p>Now God through Isaiah speaks about praise and honor -- first being honored by the wild desert creatures and then praised by human beings.</p>
<p>&quot;20The wild animals13honor14me,the jackals15and the owls,16because I provide17water in the desertand streams in the wasteland,to give drink18to my people, my chosen,21the people I formed for myselfthat they may proclaim my praise.&quot;  (verses 20-21)</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the desert honor God for providing them water in the country in which they eke out an existence. But for the humans that are just passing through the desert places, the water is God&#x27;s gracious provision until they reach the Promised Land.</p>
<p>Notice how he describes the humans -- you and me.</p>
<p>Finally, Isaiah points to our purpose -- praise.</p>
<p>&quot;... The people I formed for myselfthat they may proclaim21my praise.&quot;22(verse 21)</p>
<p>My friend, you and I were selected and formed by God himself so that we might not only appreciate and enjoy him in mutual love, but also to proclaim to others his greatness. We praise him in our times of worship, but we also brag on our God when talking to others. We are his witnesses here on earth. We have so experienced his blessings that it seems selfish to keep it to ourselves.</p>
<p>God has formed and blessed you, saved and delivered you, and is restoring and healing you so that you might have a fresh reason to spread his praises far and wide. Isaiah declared God&#x27;s words of  encouragement to Israel. To whom will your share His hope today?</p>
<p>&quot;18Forget the former things;do not dwell on the past.19See, I am doing a new thing!Now it springs up;&quot; (verses 18-19a)</p>
<p>No longer must we live in the depression of defeat and  hopelessness. By his grace we drink the fresh waters he provides in our  wilderness places and are renewed, refreshed, and retooled to serve him with joy. Hallelujah!  Amen!</p>
<p>Father, I know that many who read these words have suffered much. Some have been beaten down and defeated one too many times. I pray that your Word might heal and restore them today. Bring a miracle of renewed hope in their hearts and encourage them in faith. In Jesus&#x27; name, I pray. Amen.</p>
