<p>Jesus&#x27; commission to his disciples was: &quot;Go and make disciples of all nations&quot; (Matthew 28:19a). Many people raise their hand for prayer or come forward at an invitation to receive Christ. But how many are solid disciples two or three years later? Understanding process of becoming and growing as a disciple is crucial to both to us and to the people for whom God gives responsibility in the Lord to encourage, teach, and, perhaps, to pastor. I write this with two goals in mind. First, to encourage you to become an all-out committed disciple of Jesus, growing well in maturity and fruitfulness. Second, to encourage you to help disciple or instruct newer believers in how to follow Jesus themselves.</p>

<p>Much great material has been published in the area of discipleship and spiritual formation in the past 50 years. We owe these men and women a great debt. My humble contribution may be to ground our discipleship approaches with Scriptural models and understanding from the Bible what the process looks like, drawing upon scores of Bible passages.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s an outline of what we&#x27;ll cover in this 6-lesson  Bible study series.</p>
<p>I invite you to journey with me and thousands of brothers and sisters  world-wide through this 6-week study of The Discipleship Process. Here&#x27;s how we&#x27;ll study.</p>

<p>Please don&#x27;t sign up for more than one of my Bible  studies at one time. There&#x27;s no penalty, but each of them is pretty intensive.  If you try to do too many studies at the same time without adequate reflection,  you&#x27;ll miss out on God speaking to you.</p>
