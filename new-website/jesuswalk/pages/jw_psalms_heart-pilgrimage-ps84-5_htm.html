    <div class="article-body"><p>Psalm 84 is the outflow out of a heart of one who loves the temple of God in Jerusalem. He longs for the glorious temple, Yahweh&#x27;s dwelling place. He blesses the birds who get to make nests there, always dwelling in God&#x27;s presence. He talks about pilgrims who journey to Jerusalem to celebrate a feast day and &quot;appear before God in Zion.&quot;</p>
<p>But this psalm is more than a praise of the temple. The temple, here, is clearly a symbol of the presence of Yahweh himself. It is a  wonderful psalm that I am working to commit to memory.</p>

<p>Verse 5 keeps coming back to me again and again:</p>
<p>&quot;Blessed are those whose strength is in you,who have set their hearts on pilgrimage.&quot;(NIV)</p>
<p>There are two key words in the second line:</p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/5d644a6c_william-strutt-jerusaem-pilgrims-300x130.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>1. &quot;Heart&quot;(Hebrewlēb) is &quot;the richest biblical term for the totality of man&#x27;s inner or immaterial nature.&quot;1With this word, the psalmist indicates that he is going beyond a physical journey or pilgrimage to the temple, as was the custom of Jews all over the Holy Land. He is speaking of a heart journey, the journey of the inner person.</p>
<p>2. &quot;Highway&quot;is the Hebrew nounmĕsillâ, from the verbsālal, &quot;cast up.&quot; The word pictures a roadway that is built higher than the surrounding terrain in order to make it smoother and more level, less susceptible to washout and flooding (Isaiah 40:3-4; 57:14; 62:10). The line has been variously translated:</p>
<p>&quot;... who have set their hearts on pilgrimage.&quot; (NIV, NJB)</p>
<p>&quot;... in whose heart are the highways to Zion.&quot; (ESV, NRSV, NASB)</p>
<p>&quot;... in whose heart are the roads to Zion!&quot; (NLV)</p>
<p>&quot;... in whose heart are the ways of them.&quot; (KJV)</p>
<p>Incidentally, the word &quot;Zion&quot; doesn&#x27;t appear in the Hebrew text of verse 5, but is implied by verse 7.</p>
<p>When you put these two ideas of heart and highway together in the context of &quot;appearing before God in Zion&quot; (verse 7), you come up with the idea of a pilgrimage or deliberate travel of the heart.</p>
<p>What does that mean? For me, it means that my heart, my inner self, needs to be intentionally moving towards God. Seeking him by design. Pushing on towards him.</p>
<p>I know what spiritual stagnation looks and feels like. This  is the opposite. Growing. Moving forward. Never satisfied with where I&#x27;ve been,  but constantly seeking his Presence anew, day by day. It is a heart that seeks  God vs. a lazy heart that resists.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re like me, some days you don&#x27;tfeellike  spending time with God, of having a devotional time, what I call a &quot;quiet time.&quot;  I understand. That is the lazy, carnal heart trying to reassert itself. But I  must not let laziness prevail. So I make it a point to take time for God whether  or not  I feel like it. Like a not-so-healthy pilgrim on his way to Jerusalem at  Passover, who puts in a day of walking even if he doesn&#x27;t feel like it.</p>
<p>As I meditate on verse 5, I believe my heart this day is indeed &quot;on pilgrimage.&quot; May it always be so -- for me and, my friend, for you.</p>
<p>&quot;Blessed are those whose strength is in you,who have set their hearts on pilgrimage.&quot;(NIV)</p>
