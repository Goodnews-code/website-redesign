<p>One short verse has helped my marriage. It is tucked within among Paul&#x27;s exhortation about godly living to the Colossian church. Let me share it with you briefly.</p>
<figure class="article-figure"><img src="../scraped_data/images/e564107e_colossians-top-100x468x72.jpg" alt="Christ Is Supreme! Discipleship Lessons from Colossians and Philemon" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Christ Is Supreme! Discipleship Lessons from Colossians and Philemon</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.&quot; (Colossians 3:13)</blockquote>
<p>It is straightforward and yet profound. I see it in three parts.</p>
<p>I have what you might call idiosyncrasies, quirky habits that  I&#x27;m mostly unaware of. My wife also has her own peculiar ways. Reality check: There is little chance I&#x27;ll change her nor she&#x27;ll change me. Often, you  and I are unaware of how we offend; we bumble along without thinking. God calls us to forbearance with one another.</p>

<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Bear witheach other.&quot; (Colossians 3:13a)</blockquote>
<p>We see a similar exhortation in Ephesians:</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Be completely humble and gentle; be patient,bearing withone another in love.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:2)</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Bear with&quot;(NIV, NIV), &quot;bearing&quot; (ESV), &quot;forbearing&quot; (KJV) isanechō, &quot;to regard with tolerance, endure, bear with, put up with.&quot;1The English word &quot;forbearance&quot; refers to &quot;the act of controlling oneself when  provoked, to be patient.&quot;</p>
<p>Paul isn&#x27;t calling for grit-your-teeth, keep-your-lips-sealed anger management. He is talking about the virtue of humility, of gentleness, of patience that God seeks to grow in us, the fruit of the Spirit. Love is at the root. Romantic love (eros) between a man and a woman is wonderful, but it isn&#x27;t the point here. Paul is talking aboutagapēlove, the kind of self-giving love that Christ demonstrates for us on the cross. The kind of love that transcends and endures beyond romantic love. Romantic love can begin your marriage, but onlyagapēlove can sustain it over time.</p>
<p>Forbearance doesn&#x27;t require forgiveness since we&#x27;re not talking about sin so much as differences. It requires tolerance, patience, and love,</p>
<p>But some conflicts are based on sins committed against us. We&#x27;re not talking about unintentional slips of the tongue here, but actual sins. Sins of selfishness and lust, of greed, anger, deceit and so on. Sins that destroy relationships. Forbearance is the apostle&#x27;s first command. Forgiveness is his second command.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Forgivewhatever grievances you may have against one another.&quot; (Colossians 3:13b)</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Forgive/forgiving,&quot;is used twice in this verse. The verb ischarizomai, which comes from the rootcharis, &quot;grace.&quot;Charizomaiis often used in the sense, &quot;to give graciously,&quot; to grant or give something to someone. Twice in the New Testament it is used regarding cancelling a debt.2But here it means &quot;to show oneself gracious by forgiving wrongdoing, forgive, pardon.&quot;3Paul tells us:</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Forgive whatevergrievances4you may have against one another.&quot; (Colossians 3:13b)</blockquote>
<p>Paul doesn&#x27;t limit forgiveness to certain sins or offenses. If there is a blame, a legitimate complaint or sin -- or even if there isn&#x27;t -- we are called to forgive. One time Peter came to Jesus in frustration.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?&#x27; Jesus answered, &#x27;I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.&#x27;&quot; (Matthew 18:21-22)</blockquote>
<p>It&#x27;s great if the person repents (Luke 17:3-4). But what if they don&#x27;t? Do I have to forgive them in that case? (Romans 12:8). It is true that without repentance on their part the relationship can&#x27;t be fully restored. But the alternative cannot be to carry a silent grudge. The Bible tells us:</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Do not seek revenge5or bear a grudge6against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the Lord.&quot; (Leviticus 19:18)</blockquote>
<p>Whether or not the person repents, we still need to deal with the offense in our own hearts or it will turn to bitterness and a grudge. To truly love that person in spite of themselves, we need to let it go. If forgiving a person to their face isn&#x27;t an option, we somehow need to forgive them in our heart.</p>
<p>To help us with this, it is important to clarify what forgiveness is and is not.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what forgivenessdoesmean.To forgive means that you choose not to hold this offense, this sin, against them any longer.Period. To forgive is a decision not to hold an offense against the person from here on out.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is hard. It is costly. Forgiveness cost God the  death of his Son on the cross -- which leads us to the third part of this verse.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Forgive as the Lord forgave you.&quot; (Colossians 3:13c)</blockquote>
<p>If we need an example of the nature and extent of our forgiveness, we look to God.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;As far as the east is from the west,so far has he removed our transgressions from us.&quot; (Psalm 103:12)</blockquote>
<p>God calls us to seek reconciliation wherever possible. Reconciliation is God&#x27;s ultimate goal for his world (Ephesians 1:10; Colossians 1:20). When there is an issue between you and someone else, Jesus calls you to try to work it out without hesitation.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;And when you stand praying,if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.&quot; (Mark 11:25)</blockquote>
<p>And the flip-side is true also.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;If you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember thatyour brother has something against you,leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.&quot; (Matthew 5:23-24)</blockquote>
<p>Unforgiveness can obstruct your worship. Resentment can keep you from drawing close to God.</p>
<p>Moreover, forgiveness allows your wounded heart to heal. Forgiveness breaks chains of resentment that can otherwise enslave us. Like a rock in your shoe, your foot can&#x27;t heal until you remove it. Forgiveness has a way of flushing out bitterness and filling in that void with God&#x27;s redemptive love.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is Jesus&#x27; path -- sometimes hard, but ultimately  satisfying, right, and whole. Our verse is short, but powerful and life-changing. I encourage you to memorize it so you can recall it again and again when you are offended.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.&quot; (Colossians 3:13)</blockquote>
<p>The verse has helped my marriage and my life. My prayer is that it helps yours, too.</p>
<p>Father, change my heart. Soften it where it has become hard  and calloused through the hard knocks of life. Teach me the patience to forbear.  Help me to draw on your love so that I might forgive from the heart and so be  healed. In Jesus&#x27; name, I pray. Amen.</p>
