<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;... That you may live a life worthy of the Lord ...joyfully giving thanksto the Father, who has qualified you to share in  the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light.&quot; (Colossians 1:10, 12)</blockquote>

<p>We have so much to be thankful for! Our inheritance in Christ is ours by grace and he has qualified or enabled1us to share in a glorious inheritance! Hallelujah.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s ponder for a few minutes one of the great psalms of thanksgiving -- Psalm 100.</p>
<p>The inscription of this short Psalm is &quot;A psalm of thanksgiving (tôdâ)&quot; (NRSV). Or &quot;A Psalm. For giving thanks&quot; (NIV). The key word here the nountôdâ, &quot;confession, praise.&quot; The word was employed  uniquely in reference to a type of sacrifice, usually translated a  &quot;thank-offering.&quot; The sacrifice was accompanied with praise or confession of God  in a time of joy.2</p>

<p>One of the most beloved psalms in the Bible, Psalm 100 has  quite a history. It was closely identified with the &quot;thank-offering&quot; in the  temple, probably sung when thank-offerings were offered on the altar. In Jewish  piety, Psalm 100 is a regular part of morning prayers. &quot;Old Hundredth,&quot; based on  this psalm, is one of the great hymns of Protestant believers.</p>
<p>Psalm 100 breathes thanksgiving and praise. Let&#x27;s consider it briefly.</p>
<p>For the first three verses I&#x27;ve put the NIV and KJV translations side by side, since many of us are familiar with the more traditional translation. Notice the abundance of praise words in the first two verses.</p>
<p>&quot;1Shout for joyto the LORD,all the earth.2Worshipthe LORD withgladness;come before him withjoyful songs.&quot;(100:1-2, NIV)</p>
<p>&quot;1Make a joyful noiseunto the LORD,all ye lands.2Servethe LORD withgladness:come before his presence withsinging.&quot;(100:1-2, KJV)</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s look at some of these praise words:</p>
<p>Verses 1 and 2 are a call to joyful thanksgiving. Verse 3  gives thereasonfor the jubilation -- Yahweh is our Creator, King, and  Shepherd.</p>
<p>&quot;Know that the LORD is God.It is he who made us,and we are his;we are his people,the sheep of his pasture.&quot; (NIV)</p>
<p>&quot;Know ye that the LORD he is God:it is he that hath made us,and not we ourselves;we are his people,and the sheep of his pasture.&quot; (KJV)</p>
<p>Verse 3b can be rendered &quot;we are his&quot; (NIV, NRSV, ESV, NJB) or &quot;not we ourselves&quot; (KJV, NASB). Here&#x27;s why. The Hebrew word for &quot;not&quot; (lō&#x27;) and &quot;his&quot; (lô) sound alike. Both wordings have manuscript support. Either of the words could be used appropriately here. But the sentence goes more smoothly as &quot;and we are his.&quot; I think it also seems to fit the context better -- creation and belonging to God that is carried out in verse 3c.</p>
<p>Notice the warm sense of belonging that verse 3 creates in us. Why should we worship? (verse 1-2). Because Yahweh is God who created us. We belong to him, like a king with his people, like a shepherd and his flock. We are not alone! We belong to the family of God and are tenderly cared for as sheep. God takes responsibility for us!</p>
<p>And so we praise him! In verse 4, the psalmist calls us into the temple to present a joyful thanksgiving offering, to praise him in the courts of the temple.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Enter his gates with thanksgivingand his courts with praise;give thanks to him and praise his name.&quot; (Psalm 100:4)</blockquote>
<p>Here are more praise words. The noun is &quot;thanksgiving&quot; (tôdâ) and related verb is &quot;give thanks&quot; (yādā). The noun &quot;praise&quot; in verse 4b istehillâ, &quot;renown, praise, glory,&quot; from the verbhālal, &quot;praise, boast.&quot;8</p>
<p>In verse 4c we see the verb &quot;praise&quot; (NIV), &quot;bless&quot; (KJV,  NRSV),bārak. &quot;bless, praise, salute.&quot; When one greater blesses a person of lower status it means &quot;to endue with power for success, prosperity, fecundity, longevity, etc.&quot;9When the lesser blesses the greater, that is, God, the word means &quot;to declare God the origin of power for success, prosperity, fertility,&quot; that is, to &quot;praise God.&quot;10In this sense it appears often in the Psalms:</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;I will bless the LORD at all times;his praise shall continually be in my mouth.&quot; (Psalm 34:1; NRSV)</blockquote>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;So I will bless you as long as I live;I will lift up my hands and call on your name.&quot; (Psalm 63:4; NRSV)</blockquote>
<p>In Psalm 100:4 we are invited -- no, commanded! -- to enter his presence with thanks and praise.</p>
<p>Verse 5 gives the reason for our jubilant praise -- God&#x27;s character.</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;For the LORD is good and his love endures forever;his faithfulness continues through all generations.&quot; (Psalm 100:5)</blockquote>
<p>These are qualities that we see throughout the psalms -- his goodness and righteousness,11his steadfast love (ḥesed), and his faithfulness.12</p>
<p>Consider his steadfast love for a moment. &quot;Love&quot; (NIV), &quot;mercy&quot; (KJV), &quot;steadfast love&quot; (ESV, NRSV) isḥesed. It means more than obligatory loyalty within a covenant relationship, as some have suggested. It is a strong, steadfast, unfailing love that includes acts of kindness and mercy. The images of the KJV&#x27;s &quot;lovingkindness&quot; are not far from the fullness of the meaning of the word.13We praise him because when we are not good, he is good. When our love fails, his does not. When we are unfaithful, he is faithful. As Paul puts it:</p>
<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;If we are faithless,he will remain faithful,for he cannot disown himself.&quot; (2 Timothy 2:13)</blockquote>
<p>Why do we give thanks? Because baked into God&#x27;s core character is a faithfulness we can rely on. A steadiness we can trust. A powerful eternal God who sent his Son to rescue us.</p>
<p>Why do we thank God? For the wonderful salvation Jesus has paid for us on the cross. For the everlasting love our Father has for us. Give thanks. My friend, givegreat thanks.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lord, for your love and faithfulness to us. Teach us to praise you constantly, to ever bring thanks to your name. We love you. Thank you. In Jesus&#x27; name, we pray. Amen.</p>
