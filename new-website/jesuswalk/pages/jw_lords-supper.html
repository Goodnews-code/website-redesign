    <div class="article-body"><p>This won&#x27;t be a doctrinal study, if you mean by doctrine that I&#x27;ll give you several dogmatic propositions to believe. Nor will it be sectarian in nature.  I know that sometimes Christians fight about the Lord&#x27;s Supper.  Shame on us! There isn&#x27;t a argumentative spirit in this Bible  study, buta spirit of love and peace and acceptance of our  brothers and sisters. Instead of intellectual sparring, we  have a hunger to experience more of Christ. If you want to fight,  go elsewhere!</p>
<p>However, since &quot;doctrine&quot; really means &quot;teaching,&quot; Iwillinstruct you inwhat the Scriptures themselves teach.My goal -- both  for my own soul and yours -- is to so illuminate the rich themes  of communion so that the next time -- or 100 times -- you and I partake of the sacrament, we&#x27;ll recall with joy and love what it really means.</p>

<p>So we&#x27;re off on a spiritual adventure together, not unlike scuba diving. Communion, you see, is not a fixed doctrine, buta wonderful and holy mystery into  which we immerse ourselves, as we explore and probe its depths. If you&#x27;re a priest, pastor, or preacher,  a deacon, elder, or lay leader, you&#x27;ll find the makings of many sermons  and communion meditations here. But my prayer for you is that you first feed your own soul on the heavenly bread so that you may be spiritually nourished to feed your people.</p>
<p>I invite you to come with me on a journey through time and spirit as we explore together the Lord&#x27;s Supper. Here are the topics we&#x27;ll look at week by week:</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s how we&#x27;ll study together over the next 11 weeks (with a  couple of planned breaks):</p>

<p>You&#x27;ll receive your first lesson the Fridayafteryou sign up.There isno cost to participatein the study,  thoughdonations are encouragedso we can create more studies  and reach more people.</p>
<p>Please don&#x27;t sign up for more than one of my Bible  studies at one time. There&#x27;s no penalty, but each of them is pretty intensive.  If you try to do too many studies at the same time without adequate reflection,  you&#x27;ll miss out on God speaking to you.</p></div>
