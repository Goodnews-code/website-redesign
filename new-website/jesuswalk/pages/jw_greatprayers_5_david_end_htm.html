    <div class="article-body"><p>9The people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given freely and wholeheartedly to the Lord. David the king also rejoiced greatly.10David praised the LORDin the presence of the whole assembly, saying,</p>
<p>14&quot;But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand.15We are aliens and strangers in your sight, as were all our forefathers. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.16O LORDour God, as for all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name, it comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you.17I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things have I given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have seen with joy how willingly your people who are here have given to you.18O LORD, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Israel, keep this desire in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to you.19And give my son Solomon the wholehearted devotion to keep your commands, requirements and decrees and to do everything to build the palatial structure for which I have provided.&quot;</p>

<p>20Then David said to the whole assembly, &quot;Praise the LORDyour God.&quot; So they all praised the LORD, the God of their fathers; they bowed low and fell prostrate before the LORDand the king.</p>
<p>Prayer isn&#x27;t just asking God for favors or forgiveness. It is much more than that. A great part of Spirit-inspired prayer is praise, if the Book of Psalms is any indication. On the Day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit fell upon the church in Jerusalem, people heard them in dozens of languages &quot;declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues&quot; (Acts 2:11). &quot;Wonders&quot; (NIV), &quot;wonderful works&quot; (KJV), and &quot;deeds of power&quot; (NRSV) translate the nounmegaleios, &quot;greatness, sublimity ... mighty deeds.&quot;1That is indeed the content of many of the Psalms and the psalm we will examine today -- extolling and worshipping God in his greatness, glory, and splendor.</p>
<p>You probably participate in this kind of worship in some of the great hymns of the faith, such as &quot;Great is thy faithfulness, O God, our Father....&quot; or &quot;O worship the King, all glorious above....&quot; or &quot;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, all thy works shall praise thy name in earth and sky and sea....&quot; Some of our modern praise choruses lead us in praise,  also. But do you, dear friend, practice this kind of praise in your own personal devotions? You can. I hope from examining this psalm you can learn the elements, and then try them out in your prayers.</p>

<p>Leading up to our passage, the aged and ailing King David calls to his palace all his officials, military leaders, and administrators. Now the weak king stands to his feet to address them  concerning the temple to be built during his son Solomon&#x27;s reign.  Then he presents to Solomon from his own personal fortune gold,  silver, and bronze in great quantities to build the temple and  calls on the leaders and officials present to contribute also.  They respond with great generosity.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s where we pick up the story:</p>
<p>The common people are moved to praise when they witness this generous dedication of wealth for the future temple. This verse carries two significant words that relate to praise:</p>
<p>&quot;Rejoice&quot; (sāmah) denotes &quot;being glad or joyful with the whole disposition.&quot;2This is an instinctive response to generous and godly behavior. Our generosity can touch others; so can our stinginess.</p>

<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;Willing&quot; and &quot;freely&quot; (NIV) in verse 9 both translate the verbnādab, which &quot;connotes an uncompelled and free movement of the will unto divine service or sacrifice.&quot;3This word appears again and again in our passage. It reflects God&#x27;s desire for our worship in giving as well as our worship in praise -- uncompelled and free giving of ourselves. Sometimes we give because of a sense of duty. Duty is good; I don&#x27;t want to discourage duty. But giving out of love, &quot;freely, willingly&quot; is even better. The New Testament equivalent of this is: &quot;Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver&quot; (2 Corinthians 9:7).</blockquote>
<p>Notice here that leaders -- beginning with David himself -- set the example of giving. That inspires followers to the same selfless attitude. We leaders need to rededicate ourselves and our finances to God so that we can be leaders in giving, not just  in administrative or so-called spiritual things. Giving is as spiritual as it gets, since giving gets to the roots of   our faith, our future, and our surrender to God.</p>
<p>The people have participated in the worship of giving. Now David leads them in praise:</p>
<p>There are three important verbs we&#x27;ll see in this passage that are part of David&#x27;s vocabulary of praise. Each of them has a different flavor</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll examine these and others as we get to them in our text. But let&#x27;s look at the first. &quot;Praised&quot; (NIV) and &quot;blessed&quot; (KJV, NRSV) isbārak, &quot;to bless, to endue with power for success, prosperity, fecundity, longevity, etc.&quot;4The word is often used in the Bible in connection with the hands, though this passage doesn&#x27;t mention it. Abraham, Jacob, and Jesus lay on hands  to bless children. Both Aaron (Leviticus 9:22) and Jesus (Luke 24:50) lift up their hands in blessing and benediction (from a Latin word,benedictus, which means &quot;blessing.&quot;). It  is not surprising to learn that praying with lifted hands was the common position of prayer for the Israelites, because they were blessing God himself with their hands, hearts, and voices. (For more, see my article&quot;Lifting Hands in Worship,&quot;Paraclete, Winter 1986, pp. 4-8. www.joyfulheart.com/scholar/hands.htm).</p>
<p>David praised publicly, teaching others how to praise. Now the &quot;sweet psalmist of Israel&quot; (2 Samuel 23:1) begins his psalm. Notice how he begins by speaking of God&#x27;s qualities, kind of like the way the Lord&#x27;s Prayer begins by describing God, in this case, his eternal nature:</p>
<p>Now he begins to ascribe or attribute to God various qualities of might, strength, and glory.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s look at some of these qualities:</p>
<p>Is praise just flattering God? Buttering him up so you can ask a favor? By no means! Praise is expressing out loud the respect and honor we have for our God. That we are willing to openly declare God&#x27;s greatness encourages others to see God in this light and honor him as well.</p>
<p>Praise also affects us. When we acknowledge God&#x27;s greatness, it strengthens our own faith. Praise is the language of faith. There is a wonderful verse in which relates praise and God&#x27;s presence -- Psalm 23:3</p>
<p>&quot;But thouartholy,O thouthat inhabitest the praises of Israel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One; you are the praise of Israel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Inhabitest&quot; (KJV) or &quot;enthroned&quot; (NRSV, NIV) isyāshab, &quot;sit, remain, dwell.&quot;13There is a sense in which God&#x27;s presence is often intensely apparent within the context of a praising congregation. Our praises &quot;enthrone&quot; him here on earth. A sense of awe and love is felt by many in the room. I don&#x27;t think this is just group think or emotionalism, but a real spiritual manifestation of God&#x27;s own special presence.</p>
<p>It is significant that David the King acknowledges that the kingdom belongs to God. Many monarchs -- and people like you and me -- perceive themselves as absolute rulers of their  domain. But not David. For him, Yahweh is both the ultimate King and Head.</p>
<p>&quot;Kingdom&quot; (mamlākā), from the root for &quot;to rule as king,&quot; refers to those who are subject to his rule, his subjects, as well as the right to rule.14Israel&#x27;s understanding of their line of kings was that Yahweh was the true king. The tabernacle in the desert (and later the temple in Jerusalem) depicts the tent of a great desert monarch. The ark is his throne, the Holy of Holies his throne room. The  Holy Place typifies where the king would be served with food, incense, and light. Eventually, Israel called for a king (1 Samuel 8:4-9), but it was understood that human kings rule on his behalf, not as substitutes for his rule.</p>
<p>The doxology of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer (probably inserted by the early church in their use of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in a liturgical setting) seems draws its wording from verse 11 of this psalm. See the parallels:</p>
<p>1 Chronicles 29:11 (NIV)</p>
<p>Matthew 6:13b (NIV marg.)</p>
<p>Yours, O LORD, is the greatness</p>
<p>and the power and the glory</p>
<p>and the power and the glory</p>
<p>and the majesty and the splendor,for everything in heaven and earth is yours.</p>
<p>Yours, O LORD, is the kingdom;</p>
<p>for yours is the kingdom</p>
<p>you are exalted as head over all.</p>
<p>Hebrew poetry, of which this short psalm is an example, doesn&#x27;t rhyme. Instead it uses parallelism and the rhythm of the language in the poetry. These two lines are an example of synoptic parallelism, where both lines say the essentially the same thing in a slightly different way:</p>
<p>The first line acknowledges Yahweh as king, the second exalts him as &quot;head&quot; over all. &quot;Head&quot; (rōsh), is used here to refer to the &quot;chief&quot; of a family. In the New Testament Christ is referred to as &quot;head of the church&quot; (Ephesians 5:23 and elsewhere).15</p>
<p>David speaks of God as &quot;exalted&quot; (nāsā), from a root which means &quot;lift up, bear, carry, support.&quot;16God is seen as &quot;lifted up, exalted.&quot; Exalt is an important part of our vocabulary of praise. The English word &quot;exalt/exalts/exalted&quot; is used 91 times in the NIV, most often for God or  for those whom God exalts. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>I could go on, but you get the idea. God exalts man (as in verse 12 below, but God is exalted far above any ruler or celebrity, general, scientist, or author. He is the Exalted One! Part of praise is learning to lift him up -- exalt him -- with our words and with our heart. The praise chorus by Pete Sanchez Jr. taken from Psalm 97:9 says it all:</p>
<p>Now David continues to attribute or ascribe qualities of strength and power to God.</p>
<p>Consider the praise found in Revelation that takes place continually before God&#x27;s throne:</p>
<p>See the similarities with praise in our psalm and in the Book of Psalms? Praise focuses on who God is, not on our experience or feelings. Praise exalts our God.</p>
<p>The last two lines of this psalm are parallel to each other:</p>
<p>Here we see two important words in our praise vocabulary:</p>
<p>Now the poetic praise psalm ends, but David&#x27;s prayer continues:</p>
<p>David is marveling that he has been able to give such a quantity of gold and silver for the temple. Eighth son of a shepherd, he began with nothing, not even land to call his own. But God has blessed him and he knows it. It comes from God and belongs to God; David is only a temporary steward of God&#x27;s abundance: &quot;It comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you&quot; (29:16). Moses warned the people about overpossessiveness 3,500 years ago as they were about ready to enter the Promised Land:</p>
<p>While we believe this theoretically, we are very tempted (1) to believe that we earned our own way by the sweat of our own brow and (2) to hold our possessions tightly as our own. This is where we get in trouble with God. It is at this very point that we balk at tithing a full 10%, for example, because we believe that our wealth belongs to us rather than to God. David&#x27;s prayer reminds us: &quot;It comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you&quot; (29:16).</p>
<p>The first verse of an old hymn by William W. How says it well:</p>
<p>David rejoices at how the people have given:</p>
<p>Now David prays that this willingness and generosity towards God continue among the people after he is gone. He also prays for his son Solomon, who will ascend to the throne at his father&#x27;s death.</p>
<p>Finally, David calls the people to praise the Lord, too.</p>
<p>&quot;Praise&quot; and &quot;bless&quot; in verse 20 isbārak, which is used in verse 10 above. But here is our final praise vocabulary word for today. Notice the people&#x27;s posture -- bowing low30and falling prostrate. This last word &quot;fell prostrate&quot; (hāwā, NIV) or &quot;prostrated themselves&quot; (NRSV) is usually translated as &quot;worship&quot; in the Old Testament. It is the posture of complete submission before a superior. To bow oneself low before God is the essence of worship. Kneeling and bowing low is the common Muslim prayer posture. But Christians only bow their heads in prayer, except in Catholic and Anglican churches that have kneelers. Why is this? Priests in the Catholic tradition lie completely prostrate at their ordination. Consider trying this posture in your prayers -- not as your only posture, but as a sign and symbol of your deep worship and surrender to God.</p>
<p>We have studied David&#x27;s last recorded prayer, a prayer at the end of life. It is a psalm of praise, a song extolling the attributes of God, a prayer of wonder at God&#x27;s rich blessings, a prayer for the next king, and a call to deep worship. What can you incorporate in your prayers that you have learned from this prayer?</p>
<p>O Lord, sometimes our worship seems so half-hearted, our praise  so faint. Teach me, teach us to praise you with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. Make us a people of praise, who love to praise you. And teach us to hold only loosely the wealth you have entrusted to us. Help us to give willingly and freely, we pray. In Jesus&#x27; name. Amen.</p>

<blockquote class="scripture-quote">&quot;O LORDour God, as for all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name, it comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you.&quot; (1 Chronicles 29:16)</blockquote>
